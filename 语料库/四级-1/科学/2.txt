Engineering students are supposed to be examples of practicality and rationality, but when it comes to mycollege education 
I am an idealist and a fool. In high school I wanted to be an electrical engineer and, of course,any sensible student with my 
aims would have chosen a college with a large engineering department，famous reputation and lots of good labs and 
research equipment. But that‘s not what I did.

　　I chose to study engineering at a small liberal-arts university that doesn't even offer a major in electrical engineering. 
Obviously, this was not a practical choice; I came here for more noble reasons. I wanted a broad education that would 
provide me with flexibility and a value system to guide me in my career.I wanted to open my eyes and expand my vision by 
interacting with people who weren’t studying science orengineering. My parents, teachers and other adults praised me 
for such a sensible choice. They told me I was wise and mature beyond my 18 years,and I believed them.

　　I headed off to college sure I was going to have an advantage over those students who went to big engineering 
"factories" where they didn't care if you have values or were flexible. I was going to be a complete engineer: technical 
genius and sensitive humanist all in one.

　　Now I‘m not so sure. Somewhere along the way my noble ideals crashed into reality, as all noble ideals eventually do. 
After three years of struggling to balance math, physics and engineering courses with liberal-arts courses,I have learned 
there are reasons why few engineering students try to reconcile engineering with liberal-arts courses in college.

　　The reality that has blocked my path to become the typical successful student is that engineering and the liberal arts 
simply don’t mix as easily as I assumed in high school. Individually they shape a person in very different ways; together 
they threaten to confuse. The struggle to reconcile the two fields of study is difficult.
