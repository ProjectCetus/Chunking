Hardly a week goes by without some advance in technology that would have seemed incredible 50 years ago. And we 
can expect the rate of change to accelerate rather than slow down within our lifetime. The developments in technology 
are bound to have a dramatic effect on the future of work. By 2010, new technology will have revolutionized 
communications. People will be transmitting messages down telephone lines that previously would have been sent by 
post. Not only postmen but also clerks and secretaries will vanish in a paper-free society. All the routine tasks they 
perform will be carried on a tiny silicon chip so that they will be as obsolete as the horse and cart after the invention of 
the motorcar. One change will make thousands, if not millions, redundant.

　　Even people in traditional professions, where expert knowledge has been the key, are unlikely to escape the effects 
of new technology. Instead of going to a solicitor, you might go to a computer that is programmed with all the most 
up-to-date legal information. Doctors, too, will find that an electronic competitor will be able to carry out a much quicker 
and more accurate diagnosis and recommend more efficient courses oftreatment. In education, teachers will be largely 
replaced by teaching machines far more knowledgeable than any human being. Most learning will take place in the 
home via video conferencing. Children will still go to school though, until another place is created where they can make 
friends and develop social skills.
