people appear to born to compute. The numerical skills of children develop so early and so inexorably that it is easy to 
imagine an internal clock of mathematical maturity guiding their growth. Not long after learning to walk and talk, they can 
set the table with impress accuracy---one knife, one spoon, one fork, for each of the five chairs. Soon they are capable of 
nothing that they have placed five knives, spoons and forks on the table and, a bit later, that this amounts to fifteen pieces 
of silverware. Having thusmastered addition, they move on to subtraction. It seems almost reasonable to expect that if a 
child were secluded on a desert island at birth and retrieved seven years later, he or she could enter a second entera 
second-grade mathematics class without any serious problems of intellectual adjustment.

　　Of course, the truth is not so simple. This century, the work of cognitive psychologists has illuminated the subtle forms 
of daily learning on which intellectual progress depends. Children were observed as they slowly grasped----or, as the case 
might be, bumped into---- concepts that adults take for quantity is unchanged as water pours from a short glass into a tall 
thin one. Psychologists have since demonstrated that young children, asked to count the pencils in a pile, readily report the 
number of blue or red pencils, but must be coaxed into finding the total. Such studies have suggested that the rudiments 
of mathematics are mastered gradually, and with effort. They have also suggested that the very concept of abstract 
numbers-----the idea of a oneness, a twoness, a twoness that applies to any class of objects and is aprerequisite for doing 
anything more mathematically demanding than setting a table----is itself far from innate.
