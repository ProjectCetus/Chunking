Traditional plant breeding involves crossing varieties of the same species in ways they could cross naturally. For example, 
disease-resistant varieties of wheat have been crossed with high-yield wheat to combine these properties. This type of 
natural gene exchange is safe and fairly predictable.

　　Genetic engineering ( GE) involves exchanging genes between unrelated species that cannot naturally exchange 
genes with each other. GE can involve the exchange of genes between vastly different species — e.g. putting scorpion 
toxin genes into maize or fish antifreeze genes into tomatoes. It is possible that a scorpion toxin gene, even when it is in 
maize DNA1, will still get the organism to produce scorpion toxin — but what other effects may it have in this alien 
environment? We are already seeing this problem — adding human growth hormone genes to pigs certainly makes 
them grow — but it also gives them arthritis and makes them cross-eyed, which was entirely unpredictable.

　　It will be obvious, for example, that the gene for human intelligence will not have the same effect if inserted into 
cabbage DNA as it had in human DNA— but what side-effect would it have? In other words, is GM food2 safe to eat? 
The answer is that nobody knows because long-term tests have not been carried out.

　　Companies wanting a GM product approved in the UK or USA are required to provide regulatory bodies with results 
of their own safety tests. Monsanto’s3 soya beans were apparently fed to fish for 10 weeks before being approved. 
There was no requirement for independent testing, for long-term testing, for testing on humans or testing for specific 
dangers to children or allergic4 people.

　　The current position of the UK Government is that"There is no evidence of long-term dangers from GM foods."In 
the US, the American Food and Drug Administration5 is currently being prosecuted for covering up research that 
suggested possible risks from GM foods.
