Henry III didn't know much about biology. He went through six wives back in the 1500s, looking for one whocould bear 
him a son. Scientists now know that it's the father's sperm, not the mother's egg, which determines whether a baby is a 
boy or a girl. And last week researchers at the Genetics and IVF Institute, a private fertility center in Virginia, announced 
a new technique that will allow parents to choose the sex of their baby-to-be, before it has even been conceived. The 
scientist used a tiny laser detector to measure the DNA in millions of sperm cells as they pass single file through a 
narrow tube, like cattle being herded through a corral. In a study published last week, "girl sperm," which has 
more DNA—the genetic material— in each cell, was collected, while "boy sperm" was discarded. And when purified girl 
sperm was used to impregnate a group of mothers, 15 of 17 resulting babies turned out to be girls.

　　The researchers say that "sex selection" can also double a mother's chance of having a son and can be usedto avoid 
genetic diseases that affect only one gender, such as hemophilia. But some experts, like New York University fertility 
specialist Dr. Jamie Grifo, worry that sex selection could lead to a kind ofin uteri discrimination, especially in cultures 
where sons are considered superior to daughters. "It's valuing one gender' over another," Grifo says. "I don't think that's 
something we should be doing." So far, patients at the institute have been asking for both boys and girls, in order to 
"balance" their families. And some ethics experts say that's fine, as long as parents are just looking for a little gender 
variety. "If you have three boys, and you want a girl," says University of Texas reproductive-law professor John Robertson, 
"that's not gender bias at all."
