I’m usually fairly skeptical about any research that concludes that people are either happier or unhappier or more or 
less certain of themselves than they were 50 years ago. While any of these statements might be true, they are practically 
impossible to prove scientifically. Still, I was struck by a report which concluded that today’s children are significantly 
more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children ages 9 to 17 exhibit a higher level 
of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago.

　　Why are America’s kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation—brought on by 
high divorce rates and less involvement in community, among other things—and a growing perception that the world is 
a more dangerous place.

　　Given that we can’t turn the clock back, adults can still do plenty to help the next generation cope.

　　At the top of the list is nurturing a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. 
Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress.

　　To help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will 
thank you later. They will have more time for face-to-face relationships, and they will get more sleep.

　　Limit the amount of virtual violence your children are exposed to. It’s not just video games andmovies; children
 see a lot of murder and crime on the local news.

　　Keep your expectations for your children reasonable. Many highly successful people never attended Harvard or Yale.

　　Make exercise part of your daily routine. It will help you cope with your own anxieties and provide a goodmodel for 
your kids. Sometimes anxiety is unavoidable. But it doesn’t have to ruin your life.
