Congratulations, Mr. Jones, it's a girl."

　　Fatherhood is going to have a different meaning and bring forth a different response from every man who hears 
these words. Some feel pride when they receive the news, while others worry, wondering whether they will be good 
fathers. Although there are some men who like children and may have had considerable experiencewith them, others 
do not particularly care for children and spend little time with them. Many fathers and mothers have been planning and 
looking forward to children for some time. For other couples, pregnancy wasan accident that both husband and wife 
have accepted willingly or unwillingly.

　　Whatever the reaction to the birth of a child, it is obvious that the shift from the role of husband to that of father is 
a difficult task. Yet, unfortunately, few attempts have been made to educate fathers in this reconciliation process. 
Although numerous books have been written about American mothers, only recently has literature focused on the role 
of fathers.

　　It is argued by some writers that the change to the father's role, although difficult, is not nearly as great as the 
change the wife must take to the mother's role. The mother's role seems to require a complete transformation in daily 
routine and highly innovative(创新的) adaptation. On the other hand, the father's role is less demanding and immediate. 
However, even though we mentioned the fact that growing numbers of women are working outside the home, the 
father is still thought by many as the breadwinner in the household.
