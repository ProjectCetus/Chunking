In order to host the Olympics, a city must submit a proposal to the IOC. After all proposals have been submitted, the IOC 
votes. If no city with the fewest votes is eliminated,the voting continues, until a majority winner is determined. Typically 
the Games are awarded several years in advance, allowing the winning city time to prepare for the Games.

　　In selecting the site of the Olympic Games, the IOC considers a number of factors, and chiefly among them is which 
organizing committee seems most likely to stage the Games effectively. The IOC also considers which parts of the world 
have not yet hosted the Games. For instance, Tokyo, the host of the 1964 Summer Games, and Beijing, that of the 2008 
Games, were chosen in part to popularize the Olympic movement in Asia. Because of growing importance television 
worldwide, the IOC in recent years has also taken into account the host city's time zone. Whenever the Games take place 
in the USA or Canada, for example, American television networks are willing to pay specially higher amounts for television 
rights because they can broadcast popular events live in the best viewing hours.

　　Once the Games have been awarded, it is the duty of the local organizing committee----not the IOC or the NOC of 
the host city's country to provide them with money. This is often done with a part of the Olympic television revenues, 
and corporate sponsorships,tickets sales, and other smaller revenue sources. In many cases there is also direct 
government support.

　　Although many cities have achieved amounts of money by hosting the Games, the Olympics can be financially risky. 
When the financial gains from the Games were less than expected, the city was left with large debts.
