A friend of mine, in response to a conversation we were having about the injustices of life, asked me the question,
"Who said life was going to be fair, or that it was even meant to be fair?” Her question was agood one. It reminded 
me of something I was taught as a youngster: life isn’t fair. It’s a disappointment, but it’s absolutely true. One of the 
mistakes many of us make is that we feel sorry for ourselves, or for others, thinking that life should be fair, or that 
someday it will be. It’s not and it won’t be.

　　One of the nice things about surrendering to the fact that life isn’t fair is that it keeps us from feeling sorry for 
ourselves by encouraging us to do the very best we can with what we have. We know it’s not “life’s job”to make 
everything perfect: it’s our own challenge. Surrendering to this fact also keeps us from feeling sorry for others because 
we are reminded that everyone is dealt a different hand; everyone has unique strengths and problems in the process of 
growing up, facing the reality and making decisions; and everyone has those times that they feel unfairly treated.

　　The fact that life isn’t fair doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do everything in our power to improve our own lives or 
the world as a whole. To the contrary, it suggests that we should. When we don’t recognize or admit that life isn't fair, 
we tend to feel pity for others and for ourselves. Pity, of course, is a self-defeating emotion that does nothing for anyone, 
except to make everyone feel worse than they already do. When we do recognize that life isn’t fair, however, we feel 
compassion for others and for ourselves. And compassion is a heartfelt emotion that delivers loving-kindness to everyone 
it touches. The next time you find yourself thinking about the injustices of the world, try reminding yourself of this very 
basic fact. Youmay be surprised that it can make you out of self-pity and into helpful action.
