It’s very interesting to note where the debate about diversity is taking place. It is taking place primarily in political circles. 
Here at the College Fund, we have a lot of contact with top corporate leaders; none of them is talking about getting rid of 
those instruments that produce diversity. In fact, they say that if their companies are to compete in the global village and in 
the global market place,diversity. In fact, they say that if their companies are to compete in the global village and in the 
global market place, diversity is an imperative. They also say that the need for talented, skilled Americans means we have to 
expand the pool of potential employees. And in looking at where birth rates are growing andat where the population is 
shifting, corporate America understands that expanding the pool means promotingpolicies that help provide skills to more 
minorities, more women and more immigrants. Corporate leaders know that if that does not occur in our society, they will 
not have the engineers, the scientists, the lawyers, or the business managers they will need.

　　Likewise, I don’t hear people in the academy saying.”Let's go backward. Let's go back to the good old days, when 
we had a meritocracy” (which was never true-we never had a meritocracy, although we've come closer to  it in the last 30 
years.) I recently visited a great little college in New York where the campus has doubled its minority population in the last 
six years. I talked with an African American who has been a professor there for a long time, and she remembers that when 
she first joined the community, there were fewer than a handful of minorities on campus. Now, all of us feel the university is 
betterbecause corporate board rooms or on college campuses.
