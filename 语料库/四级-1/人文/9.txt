Like fine food, good writing is something we approach with pleasure and enjoy from the first taste to the last. And good 
writers, like good cooks, do not suddenly appear full-blown. Quite the opposite, just as the cook has to undergo a particular 
training, mastering the skills of his trade, the writer must sit at hisdesk and devote long hours to achieving a style in his 
writing, whatever its purpose is—schoolwork, matters of business, or purely social communication.

　　You may be sure that the more painstaking the effort, the more effective the writing, and the more rewarding.

　　There are still some faraway places in the world where you might find a public scribe to do your business or social 
writing for you, for money. There are a few managers who are lucky enough to have the service ofthat rare kind of secretary 
who can take care of all sorts of letter writing with no more than a quick note to work from. But for most of us, if there is 
any writing to be done, we have to do it ourselves.

　　We have to write school papers, business papers or home papers. We are constantly called on to put words to papers. 
It would be difficult to count the number of such words, messages, letters, and reports put intomails or delivered by hand, 
but the daily figures must be extremely large. What is more, everyone who writes expects, or at least hopes whatever he 
writes will be read, from first word to last, not just thrown into some “letters-to-be-read” files or into a wastepaper basket. 
This is the reason we bend our efforts toward learning and practicing the skills of interesting, effective writing.
