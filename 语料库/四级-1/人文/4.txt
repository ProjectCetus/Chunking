In bringing up children, every parent watches eagerly the child’s acquisition of each new skill- the first spoken words, the 
first independent steps, or the beginning of reading and writing. It is often tempting to hurry the child beyond his natural 
learning rate, but this can set up dangerous feelings of failure and states of worry in the child might be encouraged to learn 
to read before he knows the meaning of the words he reads. On the other hand, though, if a child is left alone too much, or 
without any learning opportunities, he loses his natural enthusiasm for life and his desire to find out new things for himself.

　　Parents vary greatly in their degree of strictness towards their children. Some may be especially strict in money matters. 
Others are sever over times of coming home at night or punctuality for meals. In general,the controls imposed represent 
the needs of the parents and the values of the community as much as the child’s own happiness.

　　As regard the development of moral standards in the growing child, consistency is very important in parental teaching. 
To forbid a thing one day and excuse it the next is no foundation for morality. Also, parents should realize that 
" example is better than precept ". If they are not sincere and do not practice what they preach, their children may grow 
confused and emotionally insecure when they grow old enough to think for themselves, and realize they have been to 
some extent fooled.

　　A sudden awareness of a marked difference between their parents’ principles and their morals can be a dangerous 
disappointment.
