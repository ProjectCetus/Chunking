That's the question raised by a thought-provoking study, The Paradox 01 Declining Female Happiness, released last 
month.The research showed that over the past 35 years women's happiness has declined, both compared to the past 
and relative to men even though, by most objective measures,the lives of women in the US have improved in recent 
decades.

　　The research, by University of Pennsylvania economists Stevenson and Wolfers, and released by the National Bureau 
of Economic Research, found the decline in happiness to be pervasive among women across a variety of demographic 
groups. The researchers, for instance, measured similar declines in happiness among women who were single Parents 
and married parents, "casting doubt on the hypothesis that trends in marriage and divorce, single parenthood or 
work/family balance are at the root of the happiness declines among women," they wrote.

　　One theory for the decline in happiness is that expectations for workplace and general advancement were raised too 
high by the women's movement and women might feel inadequate for not "having it all," as a Los Angeles Times 
columnist recently put it.

　　The researchers acknowledge that's a possibility:

　　"If the women's movement raised women's expectations faster than society was able to meet them," the paper says, "
they would be more likely to be disappointed by their actual experienced lives." But they add, things could change for 
the better: "As women's expectations move into alignment with their experiences, this decline in happiness may reverse."

　　Readers, why do you think women are unhappier than in the past? Do you think that if expectations for "having it all"
 were lowered to "move into alignment with experiences," women might be happier?
