Sign has become a scientific hot button. Only in the past 20 years have specialists in language study realized that signed 
languages are unique—a speech of the hand. They offer a new way to probe how the brain generates and understands 
language, and throw new light on an old scientific controversy: whether language,complete with grammar, is something 
that we are born With, or whether it is a learned behavior. The current interest in sign language has roots in the pioneering 
work of one rebel teacher at Gallaudet University in Washington, D. C., the world’s only liberal arts university for deaf 
people.

　　When Bill Stokoe went to Gallaudet to teach English, the school enrolled him in a course in signing. But Stokoe noticed 
something odd: among themselves, students signed differently from his classroom teacher.

　　Stokoe had been taught a sort of gestural code, each movement of the hands representing a word in English.At the 
time, American Sign Language (ASL) was thought to be no more than a form of pidgin English. But Stokoe believed the 
"hand talk”his students used looked richer. He wondered: Might deaf people actually: have a genuine language? And
 could that language be unlike any other on Earth? It was 1955, wheneven deaf people dismissed their signing as“
substandard”. Stokoe’s idea was academic heresy.

　　It is 37 years later. Stokoe—now devoting his time to writing and editing books and journals and to producing video 
materials on ASL and the deaf culture—is having lunch at a cafe near the Gallaudet campus and explaining how he started 
a revolution. For decades educators fought his idea that signed languages are natural languages like English, French and 
Japanese. They assumed language must be based on speech, the modulation of sound. But sign language is based on the 
movement of hands, the modulation of space. “What I said,” Stokoe explains, “is that language is not mouth stuff—it's 
brain stuff.”
