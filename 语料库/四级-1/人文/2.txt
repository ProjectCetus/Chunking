One of the bitterest and most time-worm debates in student union bars up and down the country is resolved as academic 
research confirms that in financial terms at least, arts degrees are a complete waste of time.Getting through university 
boosts students’earnings by 25%, on a weighted average, or $220,000 over theirlifetime, according to Professor Ian Walker 
of Warwick University-but if they study Shakespeare or the peasants’revolt instead of anatomy of contract law, those gains 
are likely to be completely wiped out.

　　The government is about to allow universities to charge students up to $3,000 a year for their degrees, arguing that 
it's a small price to pay compared with the financial rewards graduates reap later in life. But Prof. Walker's research shows 
there are sharp variations in returns according to which subject a student takes.

　　Law, medicine and economics or business are the most lucrative choices, making their average earnings 25% higher, 
according to the article, published in the office for national statistics’monthly journal. Scientists get 10-15% extra. At the 
bottom of the list are arts subjects, which make only a “small ”differenceto earnings- a small negative one, in fact. Just 
ahead are degrees in education-which leave hard pressed teachers anaverage of 5% better off a year than if they had left 
school at 18.

　　“it’s hard to resist the conclusion that what students learn does matter a lot; and some subject areas givemore 
modest financial returns than others,” Prof. Walker said. As an economist, he was quick to point outthat students might 
gain non-financial returns from arts degrees:”Studying economics might be very dull, forexample, and studying 
post-modernism might be a lot of fun.”
