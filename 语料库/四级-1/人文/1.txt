New Zealand Of The White Cloud

　　With its primeval forests, mighty snowcapped peaks, gigantic fjords and grumbling volcanoes, it's no wonder the makers
 of The Lord Of The Rings films decided to shoot the trilogy in New Zealand.

　　Rugged ranger-types can relive The Fellowship Of The Ring by scaling forbidding mountain passes or crossing volcanic 
moonscapes towards the cracks of doom2. For more adrenaline3 highs there's an unbeatable4 choice of good value 
activities, from white water rafting and jet boat rides to bungee-jumping5 and skydiving.

　　For more homely Hobbit6 types, NZ has many other attractions to enjoy — rambling countryside, a glorious coastline 
and plenty of sedate places to sit and enjoy the amazing views. And then there 's the terrific cuisine and wine.

　　With two weeks or more, a good way to see the country is to start in Auckland on the North Island, then drive to 
Wellington, crossing by ferry to the South Island. Take in the breathtaking scenery around Queenstown before flying home 
from Christchurch.

　　There's too much to see beyond Auckland and too much to justify spending too much time in the city. So head south 
to Waitomo. Hiding beneath the hilly area are the haunting Waitomo Glowworm Caves. Drift in silence in the dark on the 
subterranean lake and gaze up at the spectacular living lightshow.

　　An ideal romantic destination is Fernside, a restored historic house about an hour north of Wellington with large 
colonial-era bedrooms offing luxury bed, breakfast, lunch and dinner.

　　About midway down the South Island stands Mount Cook, the highest peak in the country at 3, 764m, surrounded by 
giant glaciers.
