Historically, more cold-adapted antelope species originating in Eurasia have migrated into Africa, 
where the climate is generally warmer, than have warm-adapted African species into Eurasia. A 
likely explanation for this involves the fact that intercontinental migrations require both a land 
bridge connecting the two continents and the suitable habitat both on and across that land bridge. 
During periods of climatic cooling, such as the various ice ages, the land bridge is open for a long 
time (because sea level remains low) and is usable by cold-adapt species because cool habitats 
then extend across it. Thus during cooling most migrants would be expected to travel toward 
Africa, which is near the equator, since this is the direction dictated by habitat changes on a 
cooling Earth. In contrast, when the Earth is warm, the land bridge is reduced or gone because sea 
level is relatively high then. Only during the short lag between onset of global temperature change 
and sea level response can warm-adapted species migrate from the equator toward higher 
latitudes.
