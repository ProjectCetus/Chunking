Recent studies of the Philippine fruit bat fauna have confirmed some previous hypotheses 
regarding bats on oceanic islands: for example, species richness[ the number of different species in 
a particular area] and abundance are generally highest in the lowlands and decrease with 
increasing elevation. With few exceptions, each endemic species [species native to a particular 
place] is restricted to the modern islands that made up a single island during periods of low sea 
level, and genetic differentiation has been influenced by the ecology of the species and the 
current and past geographic and geological conditions. However, far more previous hypotheses 
have been overturned than supported. Some endemic Philippine species use disturbed habitat as 
extensively as nonendemic species that are widespread in Southeast Asia. Levels of genetic 
variation within all species are high, not low, and rather than showing evidence of an intrinsic 
vulnerability to extinction from natural causes, independent lineages of these bats have persisted 
in rather small areas for very long periods of time(often millions of years) in spite of frequent 
typhoons and volcanic eruptions. While colonization from outside areas has clearly contributed to 
the high species richness, speciation within the archipelago has contributed at least a quarter of the 
total species richness, including many of the most abundant species.
