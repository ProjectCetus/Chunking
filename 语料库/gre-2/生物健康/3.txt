An alarming number of Mediterranean monk seals, an endangered species, have recently died.
Postmortem analysis showed the presence of an as yet unidentified virus, as well as evidence of a
know bacterial toxin. Seawater samples from the area where the seals died did contain unusually
high concentrations of the toxic bacterium. Therefore, although both viruses and bacterial toxins
can kill seals, it is more likely that these deaths were the result of the bacterial toxin.
