In the country of Seligia where asbestos has been used extensively in construction, that use is 
about to be banned, because the exposure of construction workers to asbestos can cause a certain 
type of cancer. We can predict that the ban will result in reducing the incidence of that type of 
cancer in Seligia by as much as 50 percent. 

It is true that less than 30 percent of the death certificates of Seligians who have died of that 
cancer have “construction” listed as the deceased’s occupation. The cancer takes about 20 
years after exposure to develop, however, and Seligians who have worked in construction 
commonly turn to less strenuous occupations as they age. Seligian death certificates indicate only 
the deceased’s last occupation.
