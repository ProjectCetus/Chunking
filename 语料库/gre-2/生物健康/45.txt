Columnist: Until very recently, Presorbin and Veltrex, two medications used to block excess 
stomach acid, were both available only with a prescription written by a doctor. In an advertisement 
for Presorbin, its makers argue that Presorbin is superior on the grounds that doctors have written 
200 million prescriptions for Presorbin, as compared to 100 million for Veltrex. It can be argued 
that the number of prescriptions written is never a worthwhile criterion for comparing the 
merits of medicines, but that the advertisementâ€™s argument is absurd is quite adequately revealed 
by observing that Presorbin was available as a prescription medicine years before Veltrex was.
