When selecting a nest, the female of the river blenny (a small fish) appears to be sensitive to both 
size and orientation. Blennies deposit their eggs preferably in nests under large stones and in nests 
facing southeast. Southeast-facing nests contain larger egg clutches, a fact that cannot be 
completely explained by differences in nest stone sizes. Moreover, in a recent study, current 
speeds upstream of the nest and at the nest entrance were similar for nests facing southeast and 
those facing in other directions. A southeast-facing entrance per se thus seems to be the specific 
nest feature preferred by females, rather than the effect of selective positioning on current at nest 
entrance. The reasons for this preference are unclear, however.
