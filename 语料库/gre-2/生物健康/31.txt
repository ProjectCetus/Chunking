Although the passenger pigeons, now extinct, were abundant in eighteenth-and nineteenth- 
century America, archaeological studies at twelfth-century Cahokian sites in the present day 
United States examined household food trash and found that traces of passenger pigeon were quite 
rare. Given that the sites were close to a huge passenger pigeon roost documented by John James 
Audubon in the nineteenth century and that Cahokians consumed almost every other animal 
protein source available, the archaeologists conducting the studies concluded the passenger 
pigeon population had once been very limited before increasing dramatically in post-Columbian 
America. Other archaeologists have criticized those conclusions on the grounds that passenger 
pigeon bones would not be likely to be preserved. But all the archaeological projects found plenty 
of bird bones and even tiny bones from fish.
