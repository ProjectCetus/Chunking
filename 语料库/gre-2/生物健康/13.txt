There have been numerous well-documented extinctions of indigenous species caused by the 
introduction of non-indigenous predators and pathogens. However, surprisingly few extinctions of 
indigenous species can be attributed to competition from introduced species. For example, during 
the past 400 years, 4,000 plant species have been introduced into North America, and these 
non-indigenous plants currently account for nearly 20 percent of North Americaâ€™s plant species. 
Yet no evidence exists that any indigenous North American plant species became extinct as a 
result of competition from new species could mean that such extinctions take longer to occur 
than scientists initially believed or, alternatively, that extinctions are rarely caused by competition 
from non-indigenous species.
