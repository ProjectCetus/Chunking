Although social learning (the acquisition of specific behaviors by observing other individuals
exhibiting those behaviors ) is well documented among fish, few studies have investigated social
learning within a developmental context in these taxa. Rather than investigating the development
of a particular skill, Chapman, Ward, and Krause investigated the role of group density during
development in later foraging success in laboratory-housed guppies. When raised with a small
number of conspecifics (members of the same species), guppies were quicker to locate food by
following a trained adult guppy than were guppies raised in large groups. This counterintuitive
finding is explained by the fact that guppies reared in the high- density condition were less likely
to shoal (swim in a group ) with others and, therefore, were less likely to learn the benefits of
social learning. Instead, fish reared in high-density situations may learn that conspecifics are to be
viewed as competitors, rather than as potential sources of adaptive information. This finding
suggests that at least for guppies, the early social environment may have an effect on the capacity
for social learning, if not on the socially learned behaviors themselves.
