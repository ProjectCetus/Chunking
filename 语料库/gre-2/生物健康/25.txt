In general, naive individuals appear more likely to learn from interaction with familiar rather 
than unfamiliar members of their species. Kaveliers and colleagues (2005) reported that naive 
laboratory-bred deer mice showed greater social learning of defensive responses to biting flies 
after observing responses of familiar members than after observing responses of unfamiliar 
members. Earlier, Valsecchi and colleagues (1996) reported striking differences in social 
learning of food preferences among Mongolian gerbils, depending on whether they were 
exposed to familiar or unfamiliar demonstrators. At the time, this was unexpected because 
Gaief and colleagues (1984) had previously reported no familiarity effect in Norway rats on social 
learning of food preferences. However, Gaief et al (1998) subsequently uncovered a significant 
familiarity effect that was evident when demonstrators are some hours before interacting with 
observers but absent when demonstrators are immediately before interacting.
