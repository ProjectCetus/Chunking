Princessfish are a species of coral-reef fish that are captured alive by divers who first stun the 
individual fish by squirting a certain poison at them. Since the divers limit their catch to a few 
individuals and take care not to overfish, the diversâ€™ continuing activities will clearly not result 
in serious harm to populations of princessfish.
