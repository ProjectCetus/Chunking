The use of nets at beach resorts to protect swimming areas from sharks has been criticized by 
environmentalists because the nets needlessly kill thousands of marine animals annually. 
However, environmentalists have recently discovered that an electrified cable buried beneath the 
periphery of swimming areas causes sharks to swim away while harming neither humans nor 
marine life. Hence, by installing such cables, resort communities will be able to maintain tourism 
while satisfying environmentalists' concerns.
