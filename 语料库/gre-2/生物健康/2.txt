Although many hypotheses have been proposed to explain why some plant communities are more
susceptible than others to invasion by nonnative species, results from field studies have been
inconsistent and no general theory of invasibility has yet emerged. However, a theory based on
fluctuating resource availability could integrate most existing hypotheses and successfully resolve
many of the apparently conflicting and ambiguous results of previous studies. The suggested
theory is that a plant community becomes more susceptible to invasion whenever there is an
increase in the amount of unused resources.

The diversity in the range of resource-release mechanisms could partly explain the absence of
consistent ecological correlates of invasibility. In particular, the theory predicts that there will
be no necessary relationship between the species diversity of a plant community and its
susceptibility to invasion, since near-complete exploitation can each occur in both species-rich and
species-poor communities. Though Lonsdale found a positive association between species
richness and invasion, this may arise from the tendency of diverse plant communities to be
nutrient poor and therefore more responsive to the effects of human-caused influxes of nutrients.
