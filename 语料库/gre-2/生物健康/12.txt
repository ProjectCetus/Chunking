When studying shrimp feeding from hydro-thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean, biologists 
were surprised that the shrimpsâ€™ reproductive cycles followed seasonal patterns. Far beyond the 
reach of sunlight, and with food abundant around the vents all year round, why should such 
animals reproduce seasonally? The answer might involve their offspring, which in their larval 
form drift in the currents to colonize new vents. The larvae must feed during their trip, and their 
springtime release coincides with a peak in algae raining down from surface waters. So far, 
researchers have found no evidence of seasonal breeding among vent-dwelling species that 
provide their offspring with yolk to sustain them or among vent-dwelling species found in 
areas of the ocean with not seasonal algae blooms.
