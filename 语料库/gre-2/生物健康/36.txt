Some researchers claim that cetaceans—whales and dolphins—have culture, which the 
researchers define as the ability to learn from one another. Skeptics, however, demand clear 
evidence that cetaceans can acquire new behaviors through some form of social learning, 
preferably clear-cut instances of imitation or teaching. But such evidence is difficult to obtain. 
While few people doubt that captive cetaceans are adept at imitation or that they reproduce 
behaviors taught by researchers, biologists seeking insight into cetaceans’ behavior in their natural 
habitats must rely on deduction rather than experiments. If members of a particular group share 
behaviors that do not result from genetic inheritance or environmental variation, then they 
have almost certainly learned them by watching, following, or listening to other animals.
