Biologists studying wild monkeys sometimes need the genetic material DNA from a particular 
monkey to determine the animal's parentage. Until recently, DNA could be extracted only from 
blood. Collecting a blood sample required tranquilizing the donor animal. Now DNA can be 
extracted from hair. Monkeys shed large quantities of hair in places where they sleep.
 
Therefore, researchers will now be able to determine the parentage of individual monkeys from 
DNA without tranquilizing the monkeys.
