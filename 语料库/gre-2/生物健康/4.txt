Biologists have long debated about whether egg production in birds is biologically highly
costly, some theorizing that egg production is energetically or nutritionally demanding. Lack,
however, suggested that clutch size—the number of eggs a bird lays per breeding cycle—is far
below the potential limit of egg production. He suggested that clutch size had instead evolved
in relation to the number of young that the parents could successfully rear. Subsequently, most
studies focused on limitations operating during chick rearing, particularly among altricial
species (species in which the parents feed their young in the nest). Lack later recognized that
in precocial species (species in which young feed themselves), clutch size might be explained by
different factors—the availability of food for egg-laying females, for example.
