An influential early view held that ecosystems contain niches for a limited number of species and 
that competition for resources among species—whether native or nonnative invading ones 
—determines ecosystems’ species composition. However, factors other than competition often 
help explain invading species’ success. For example, the American grey squirrel, often cited as 
a classic example of competitively superior invading species, was introduced in England in 1876 
and now thrives, while the native red squirrel population has declined. Although scientists have 
found gray squirrels to be more efficient foragers than red ones, they also note that even before the 
gray squirrel’s arrival, Britain’s red squirrel populations had a periodic tendency to die out, only to 
be subsequently reintroduced. Furthermore, many gray squirrels are silent carriers of a disease 
fatal to red squirrels.
