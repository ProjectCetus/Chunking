Some attine ants carry vegetation into their nests and add fungal material, thereby creating 
“gardens” in which fungal food for the ants grow. Because the ants play the behaviorally active 
role, it seems compelling to say that they cultivate and control the passive fungi. But even if that 
is true, the symbiotic association has existed for so long that cultivar traits may have evolved in 
the fungi that benefit the fungi but not necessarily the ants. Furthermore, many microorganisms 
have developed sophisticated mechanisms to manipulate the physiology and behavior of their 
symbiotic animals. It is not implausible, therefore, that the ants’ fungi have evolved chemical and 
physiological schemes that alter ant behavior to serve the fungus’ reproductive interests, possibly 
even compromising the reproductive interests for the ant hosts.
