Soil communities are dependent on plants for organic matter. Plants provide organic matter for soil 
communities through the decomposition of leaf litter, by oozing nutrients from roots, or through 
other methods of deposition of organic compounds into the soil environments. As a result of these 
diverse methods by which plants supply resources, unique soil communities form under different 
plant species and under plant communities that differ in composition. If a nonnative plant species 
invades an above-ground community of flora and fauna, it can alter links between the native 
above-ground community and the below-ground soil community. For example, an invading 
nonnative plant could alter the quantity of leaf litter production, which would alter nutrient 
contributions to the soil.
