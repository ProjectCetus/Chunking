Prominent among theories of the function of sleep is Meddisâ€™ immobilization hypothesis, which 
holds that sleep, rather than serving a restorative function, plays a protective role during times that 
animals cannot be usefully engaged in other activities. Meddis reasoned that animals not 
immediately threatened by predators would be safer if they passed the time sleeping.
 
However, that hypothesis cannot easily explain why one often observes a rebound in sleep time or 
intensity following a period of sleep deprivation. Neither does the hypothesis explain the existence 
of various states of sleep, which themselves may be associated with different functions.
