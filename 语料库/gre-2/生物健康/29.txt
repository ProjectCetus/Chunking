Most mammals reach sexual maturity when their growth rates are in decline, whereas humans 
experience a growth spurt during adolescence. Whether apes experience an adolescent growth 
spurt is still undecided. In the 1950s, data on captive chimpanzees collected by James Gavan 
appeared devoid of evidence of an adolescent growth spurt in these apes. In a recent reanalysis of 
Gavan’s data, however, zoologist Elizabeth Watts has found that as chimpanzees reach sexual 
maturity, the growth rate of their limbs accelerates. Most biologists, however, are skeptical that 
this is a humanlike adolescent growth spurt. While the human adolescent growth spurt is 
physically obvious and affects virtually the entire body, the chimpanzee’s increased growth rate is 
detectable only through sophisticated mathematical analysis. Moreover, according to scientist 
Holly Smith, the growth rate increase in chimpanzees begins when 86% of full skeletal growth 
has been attained, whereas human adolescence generally commences when 77 percent of full 
skeletal growth has occurred.
