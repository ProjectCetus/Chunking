Our terrestrial food supply comes from ecosystems transformed to produce a few comestible 
species through the removal of competitors, predators, and pests, but marine capture fisheries 
depend on the overall productivity of natural ecosystems. There is, however, increasing concern 
about the impact of fishing and other human activities on marine ecosystems, which are now far 
from pristine. One option for moving toward both biodiversity and terrestrial food supply goals is 
to produce greater yields from less land, thereby freeing land for conservation purposes. By 
contrast, the objective of maintaining or resorting the biodiversity of marine ecosystems may 
conflict with the objective of maintaining or increasing our food supply from the sea, since the 
level of fishing required to achieve the latter may compromise the former.
