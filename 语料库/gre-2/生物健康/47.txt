Oscillatory swimming—the alternating of deep dives with forays toward the surface—is among 
the most common behaviors of large marine animals in the open ocean. The reason most often 
proposed for this behavior is to warm the body after heat loss during descent into cooler water. 
Tuna, mako sharks, and white sharks maintain an internal body temperature above that of the 
surrounding waters thereby improving their muscular efficiency and enabling them to swim with 
bursts of speed.
