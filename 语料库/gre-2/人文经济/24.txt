The relevance of the literary personality—a writer’s distinctive attitudes, concerns, and artistic 
choices—to the analysis of a literary work is being scrutinized by various schools of contemporary 
criticism. Deconstructionists view the literary personality, like the writer’s biographical 
personality, as irrelevant. The proper focus of literary analysis, they argue, is a work’s 
intertextuality( interrelationship with other texts), subtexts (unspoken, concealed, or repressed 
discourses), and metatexts (self-referential aspects), not a perception of a writer’s verbal and 
aesthetic “fingerprints.” New historicists also devalue the literary personality, since, in their 
emphasis on a work’s historical contexts, they credit a writer with only those insights and ideas 
that were generally available when the writer lived. However, to readers interested in literary 
detective work--say scholars of classical( Greek and Roman) literature who wish to reconstruct 
damaged texts or deduce a work’s authorship—the literary personality sometimes provides vital 
clues.
