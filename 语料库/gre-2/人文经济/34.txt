Historian Colin Calloway argues that in the late colonial period preceding the American 
Revolution (1775-1783), the British government sought to seal off territory west of the 
Appalachian Mountain from the encroachment of land-hungry White settlers, to negotiate with 
Native American peoples as independent foreign states, and to guarantee the integrity of 
traditional native American hunting grounds. By contrast, White Americans, released by the out 
break of the Revolution from the constraints of Britain’s allegedly benevolent policies, are 
portrayed by Calloway as ruthless land-grabbers whose new national government endorsed their 
rapacity. Bernard Bailyn argues, however, that the “Americans” who encroached on Native 
American land during the Revolution had been British only a few years before. When, during and 
after the Revolution, White Americans seized Native American land by any available means, they 
were continuing a tradition dating back to the earliest years of English settlement in North 
America. And, according to Bailyn, the British government’s prewar efforts to preserve the 
trans-Appalachian west for Native Americans resulted not from humanitarian virtue or ethnic 
tolerance but from British Merchants’ desire to maintain their lucrative trade with native 
Americans and the government’ s desire to control immigration and avoid costly conflict between 
White and Native Americans over land.
