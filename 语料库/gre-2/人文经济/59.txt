The “deindustrialization” thesis of Bluestone and Harrison asserts that the replacement of 
domestic with foreign manufacturing begun by United States corporations in the late 1960s 
resulted in a “hollowing out” of American industry, whereby workers displaced from 
manufacturing jobs through massive plant closings found themselves moving more or less 
permanently into lower-paying, less secure jobs or into unemployment. Critics of the 
deindustrialization thesis have argued that new service and high-technology sectors of the United 
States economy have recently created a substantial number of jobs. While these critics do not deny 
the painful aspects of this transition from an industrial to a service- and information-based 
economy, they argue that it will be short-term, and a necessary evil if the United States is to have 
long-term increases in living standards. Critics of the emerging economy, however, point to 
disturbing evidence of an “hourglass” effect: a shrinking middle tier of managerial and 
blue-collar unionized workers and consequent polarization of incomes. The emergence of a 
technical and financial elite, they argue, has brought forth a host of low- wage jobs to service the 
new economy, and it is this service sector that many ex-industrial workers must seek.
