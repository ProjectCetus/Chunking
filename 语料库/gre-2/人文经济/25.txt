The manuscripts of the eight extant Latin tragedies identify the plays as the Marci Lucii Annei 
Senecae Tragoediae. Since nobody of that name is known, modern scholars believe the dramasto 
be the work of Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger, the well-known philosopher, orator and 
politician. Clearly the tragedies were written during Seneca’s lifetime: internal references to 
earlier poets, most notably Ovid, indicate that the dramas cannot have been composed prior to the 
second decade C.E., and the plays must have been written by 96C.E., when Quintilian quotes 
Medea, one of the tragedies. 

It is remarkably, however, that Seneca himself never mentions the plays, since there are certain 
passages in them that could be used to illustrate points of his philosophy. There are at least two 
possible explanations. In the early Roman Empire, playwrights were sometimes exiled or 
executed for line constructed as directed against the emperor; thus, Seneca’s silence may be 
simple prudence. But if anyone could safely attach his name to dramas, surely it would be Seneca, 
the emperor’s tutor. And although Herrmann offers Seneca’s modesty as an explanation, Seneca is 
not averse to referring to his other writings. The evidence for equating Seneca with the author of 
the tragedies seems circumstantial.
