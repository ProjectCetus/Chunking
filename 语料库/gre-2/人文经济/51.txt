Unlike most Jane Austen scholarship before 1980, much recent scholarship analyzes the novels of 
Austen, who lived from 1775 to 1817, in the context of Austen’s tumultuous times, which saw the 
French and American revolutions and the Napoleonic Wars. Yet Frantz notes another revolution, 
rarely mentioned in Austen scholarship: the Great Masculine Renunciation that altered 
conventions in men’s dress and behavior. During the later eighteenth century, wealthy gentlemen 
exchanged the velvets and satins long in fashion for somber woolen suits. Frantz contends that this 
change reflected deeper cultural changes. The value once placed on men’s expressiveness, 
reflected in Mackenzie’s novel The Man of Feeling (1771), gave way to a preference for 
emotional restraint. In Austen’s novels, the heroine often struggles to glimpse the true nature of 
hero beneath his reserved exterior.
