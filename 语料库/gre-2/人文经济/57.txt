A critical consensus has emerged that Mary McCarthy will be remembered primarily as an 
essayist rather than as a novelist. But despite her formidable gifts as a polemical and discursive 
writer, and for all her reputation as an intellectual who sacrificed feeling to intelligence, what 
powers McCarthy’s best essays are her fictional rather than strictly intellectual gifts. She makes 
her points by telling stories or by way of vivid description, arresting images and subtle 
characterization. And for all her exacting sense of fact, McCarthy’s greatest contribution was to 
blur the distinctions between different kinds of prose writing: to show how fiction could be 
opened up to the thinking mind and how essays could profit from the techniques of fiction.
