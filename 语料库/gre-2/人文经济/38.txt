Following the United States Civil War (1861-1865), many former slaves in the rural South became 
sharecroppers (raising a landlordâ€™ s crop for a share of the profits) or tenant farmers (selling what 
they raised and paying a share of the profits as rent). Most historians tend to depict these 
African Americans as victims of racism and the farm tenancy system. This approach, however, 
overlooks the role played by such African American rural reformers as Robert Lloyd Smith, 
founder of the Farmers' Improvement Society of Texas, and Joseph Elward Clayton, the first 
African American to organize farmers' institutes for the Texas Department of Agriculture. Both 
men advocated comfortable homes and better schools for African Americans; both attributed 
poverty and illiteracy to causes other than racism, such as insect damage to crops; and both 
worked to keep Black farmers on the land, although Smith opposed farm tenancy. Both were also 
accused by their contemporaries of downplaying the devastating impact of the farm tenancy 
system on Black farmers and of accommodating racism. While the extent of these reformers' 
influence requires more study, clearly their organizations provided a voice for African American 
farmers seeking to improve their positions in the agrarian South.
