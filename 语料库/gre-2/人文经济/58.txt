Some archaeologists speculate that the Americas might have been initially colonized between 
40,000 and 25,000 years ago. However, to support this theory it is necessary to explain the 
absence of generally accepted habitation sites for that time interval in what is now the United 
States. Australia, which has a smaller land area than the United States, has many such sites, 
supporting the generally accepted claim that the continent was colonized by humans at least 
40,000 years ago. Australia is less densely populated (resulting in lower chances of discovering 
sites) and with its overall greater aridity would have presented conditions less favorable for 
hunter-gatherer occupation. Proportionally, at least as much land area has been lost from the 
coastal regions of Australia because of postglacial sea-level rise as in the United States, so any 
coastal archaeological record in Australia should have been depleted about as much as a coastal 
record in the United States. Since there are so many resource-rich rivers leading inland from the 
United States coastlines, it seems implausible that a growing population of humans would have 
confined itself to coasts for thousands of years. If inhabitants were present 25,000 years ago, the 
chances of their appearing in the archaeological record would seem to be greater than for 
Australia.
