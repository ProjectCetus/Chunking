Before feminist literary criticism emerged in the 1970s, the nineteenth-century United States
writer Fanny Fern was regarded by most critics (when considered at all) as a prototype of weepy
sentimentalism—a pious, insipid icon of conventional American culture. Feminist reclamations of
Fern, by contrast, emphasize her nonsentimental qualities, particularly her sharply humorous
social criticism. Most feminist scholars find it difficult to reconcile Fern’s sardonic social critiques
with her effusive celebrations of many conventional values.

Attempting to resolve this contradiction, Harris concludes that Fern employed flowery
rhetoric strategically to disguise her subversive goals beneath apparent conventionality.
However, Tompkins proposes an alternative view of sentimentality itself, suggesting that
sentimental writing could serve radical, rather than only conservative ends by swaying readers
emotionally, moving them to embrace social change.
