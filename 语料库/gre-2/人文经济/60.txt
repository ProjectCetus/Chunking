The revival of mural painting that has occurred in San Francisco since the 1970s, especially 
among the Chicano population of the city’s Mission District, has marked differences from its 
social realist forerunner in Mexico and the United States some 40 years earlier. Rather than being 
government sponsored and limited to murals on government buildings, the contemporary 
mural movement sprang from the people themselves, with murals appearing on community 
buildings and throughout college campuses. Perhaps the biggest difference, however, is the 
process. In earlier twentieth-century Mexico, murals resulted from the vision of individual artists. 
But today’s murals are characteristically the products of artists working with local residents on 
design and creation.
