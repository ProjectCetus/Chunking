One of the reasons why many early British colonies in North America failed amid the New 
World’s abundance was that the settlers’ mindset prevented them from living like the native 
inhabitants. From Native Americans, the settlers learned such skills as building brushwood weirs 
to trap fish, but they did not adopt the real key to success: mobility. The whole intellectual 
foundation of European civilization was fixity- a worldview profoundly different from that of 
Native Americans, who moved in response to changing food resources. Settlers were drawn to 
North America by tales its extraordinary abundance, not realizing that abundance is seasonal. 
Culture and ecological knowledge allowed Native Americans to exploit different food sources at 
different time of year.
