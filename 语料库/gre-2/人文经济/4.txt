An Irish newspaper editorial encouraging women to participate in the non-importation movement
launched in Ireland in 1779 appears consistent with a perception that the political use of the
consumer boycott originated in North America and spread eastwards across the Atlantic to Ireland.
This is a view that most historians have concurred with. For example, T.H. Breen argued that the
consumer boycott was a brilliantly original American invention. Breen did acknowledge that a 
few isolated boycotts may have taken place in other countries. However, Mary O.Dowd argues
that from the late seventeenth century, Irish political discourse advocated for the nonconsumption
of imported goods and support for home manufactures by women in ways that were strikingly
similar to those used later in North America.
