Writing about nineteenth-century women’s travel writing, Lila Harper notes that the four women 
she discussed used their own names, in contrast with the nineteenth-century female novelists who 
either published anonymously or used male pseudonyms. The novelists doubtlessly realized that 
they were breaking boundaries, whereas three of the four daring, solitary travelers espoused 
traditional values, eschewing radicalism and women’s movements. 

Whereas the female novelists criticized their society, the female travelers seemed content to leave 
society as it was while accomplishing their own liberation. In other words, they lived a 
contradiction. For the subjects of Harper’s study, solitude in both the private and public spheres 
prevailed—a solitude that conferred authority, hitherto a male prerogative, but that also precluded 
any collective action or female solidarity.
