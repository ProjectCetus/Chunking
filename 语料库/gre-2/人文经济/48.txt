In the early twentieth century, small magazines and the innovative graphics used on them created 
the face of the avant-guard. It was a look that signaled progressive ideas and unconventionality 
because it dispensed with the cardinal rule of graphic design: to take an idea and make it 
visually clear, concise, and instantly understood. Instead, graphics produced by avant-guard artists 
exclusively for the avant-guard (as opposed to their advertising work) were usually difficult to 
decipher, ambiguous, or nonsensical. This overturning of convention, this assailing of standard 
graphic and typographic formats, was part of a search for intellectual freedom. The impulse 
toward liberation enabled avant-guardists to see with fresh eyes untried possibilities for arranging 
and relating words and images on paper.
