Feminist scholars have tended to regard women in the nineteenth-century United States who 
elected to remain single as champions of women’s autonomy and as critics of marriage as an 
oppressive institution. Indeed, many nineteenth-century American women who participated in 
reform movements or who distinguished themselves as writers and professionals were single. Yet 
this view of single women tends to distort the meaning of their choices. The nineteenth century 
saw the elevation of marriage for love as a spiritual ideal. Consequently, it became socially 
acceptable for women not to marry if such an ideal marriage could not be realized with an 
available suitor. Thus, many women’s choice to remain single reflected not a negative view of 
marriage but a highly idealistic one.
