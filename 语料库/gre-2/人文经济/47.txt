Although vastly popular during its time, much nineteenth-century womenâ€™s fiction in the United 
States went unread by the twentieth-century educated elite, who were taught to ignore it as  
didactic. However, American literature has a tradition of didacticism going back to its Puritan 
roots, shifting over time from sermons and poetic transcripts into novels, which proved to be 
perfect vehicles for conveying social values. In the nineteenth century, critics reviled Poe for 
neglecting to conclude his stories with pithy moral tags, while Longfellow was canonized for 
his didactic verse. Although rhetorical changes favoring the anti-didactic can be detected as 
nineteenth-century American transformed itself into a secular society, it was twentieth-century 
criticism, which placed aesthetic value above everything else, that had no place in its doctrine for 
the didacticism of others.
