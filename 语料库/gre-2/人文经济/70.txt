Stylistic evidence and laboratory evidence strongly support the claim that the magnificent painting 
Garden of Eden is a work of the Flemish master van Eyck. Nevertheless, the painting must have 
been the work of someone else, as anyone with a little historical and zoological knowledge can 
tell merely by looking at the painting. The animals in the painting are all vivid representations 
of actual animals, including armadillos. Yet armadillos are native only to Americas, and van 
Eyck died decades before Europeans reached the Americas.
