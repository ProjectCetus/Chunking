The editors of the essay collection Romantic biography tell us repeatedly that biography is an 
invention of the Romantic period in British literature (late eighteenth and early nineteenth 
centuries), yet we are never shown that process of invention motion. Hazlitt, the most prominent 
example of the Romantic biographer, is almost invisible. The Romantic period was not just the 
period in which biography was inventedâ€”or, rather, the period in which some of its informing 
principles were invented, since biography could just as easily be said to have originated in the 
scandalous memoirs that formed part of the pre-Romantic culture of the novel. It was also the 
period in which biography, through its sheer ubiquity, became an object of major ideological 
significance within British culture.
