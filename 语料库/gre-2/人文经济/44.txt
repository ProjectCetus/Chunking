A divide between aesthetic and technical considerations has played a crucial role in mapmaking 
and cartographic scholarship. Since nineteenth century cartographers, for instance, understood 
themselves as technicians who did not care about visual effects, while others saw themselves as 
landscape painters. That dichotomy structured the discipline of the history of cartography. Until 
the 1980s, in what Blakemore and Harley called “the Old is Beautiful Paradigm,” scholars largely 
focused on maps made before 1800, marveling at their beauty and sometimes regretting the 
decline of the pre-technical age. Early mapmaking was considered art while modern cartography 
was located within the realm of engineering utility. Alpers, however, has argued that this boundary 
would have puzzled mapmakers in the seventeenth century, because they considered themselves to  
be visual engineers.
