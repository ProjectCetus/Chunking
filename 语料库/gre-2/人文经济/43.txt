Editors of major United States newsmagazines have been criticized for reducing the amount of 
space these magazines devote to international news. According to these editors, however, readers 
are wholly to blame for the reductions. After all, the editors point out, sales of magazine issues 
that prominently feature international news stories have declined significantly, and declining sales 
reflect declining reader interest. Yet even if true, this evidence does not refute the contention that 
editors are merely passive instruments responding to reader interest. And that is clearly an 
untenable view, since editors can often intensify reader interest in a news topic by giving it 
frequent coverage.
