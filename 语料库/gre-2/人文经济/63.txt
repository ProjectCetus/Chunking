Analyzing levels of proportional representation of American Indians in state and local government 
jobs is important for several reasons. First, the basic idea underlying the theory of representative 
bureaucracy is that the demographic composition of bureaucracy should mirror the demographic 
composition of the general public. This is because in addition to its symbolic value, increased 
access to managerial position may lead to greater responsiveness on the part of policy makers to 
the policy interests of traditionally disadvantaged groups such as American Indians. Second, the 
focus on higher level jobs in bureaucracies (as opposed to non-managerial positions) is especially 
important because managerial positions represent a major  source of economic progress for members 
of traditionally disadvantaged groups, as these jobs  confer good salaries, benefits, status, security, and 
mobility. Third, it is important to know if there has been growth in the American Indian share of more 
desirable public sector positions over the last two decades. For instance, Peterson and Duncan argue 
that the population and power of American Indians have been growing in certain states. Peterson and 
Duncan also suggest that this growth may reflect the possibility that American Indian population are 
becoming more active in nontraditional areas of politics, assimilating into mainstream culture, and securing 
with greater frequency leadership positions in non-tribal government.
