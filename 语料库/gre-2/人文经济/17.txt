Archaeologists studying Bonito phase (ca. A.D. 900-1140) Native American ceramics from Chaco 
Canyon, New Mexico, observed that many pots had been altered after firing to revise their 
decorative designs--usually, intricate geometric patterns painted in black on white slipped surfaces. 
In some cases, a new design was imposed over an earlier one; less often, the original design was 
simply covered with white slip. Crown and Wills doubt that the alterations were made to correct 
design errors. Many Chaco pots with design errors were left unaltered. Furthermore, when errors 
were corrected, revisions were made prior to firingâ€”either by painting directly over the error or 
by scraping off designs and applying new slip and paint, which is a less time-consuming method 
than repainting and refiring flawed pots.
