Although Elizabeth Stuart Phelps’ novel Doctor Zay (1882) dominates critical discussion of 
Phelps’ interest in woman doctors, preceding it were many little-known writings by Phelps. These 
writings underscored the achievements of already established women doctors, the imperative of 
medically educating and training women in the face of pernicious resistance, and the medical 
woman’s symbolic value as an agent of healing in post-Civil War America. An exploration of this 
largely overlooked early prose demonstrates that Phelps played an instrumental role in 
legitimizing the American medical woman during a crucial earlier period when the number of 
women doctors in the United States increased substantially, but the woman doctor remained 
perhaps the most controversial new presence on the nation’s occupational landscape.
