As it was published in 1935, Mules and Men, Zora Neale Hurston's landmark collection of
folktales, may not have been the book that its author first had in mind. In this anthropological
study, Hurston describes in detail the people who tell the stories, often even inserting herself into
the storytelling scene. Evidently, however, Hurston had prepared another version, a manuscript
that was recently discovered and published after having been forgotten since 1929. This version
differs from Mules and Men in that it simply records stories, with no descriptive or interpretive
information.

While we cannot know for certain why Hurstonâ€™s original manuscript went unpublished during her
lifetime, it may have been because publishers wanted something more than a transcription of tales.
Contemporary novelist and critic John Edgar Wideman has described Black literature as the
history of a writing that sought to escape its frame, in other words, as the effort of Black writers to
present the stories of Black people without having to have a mediating voice to explain the
stories to a non-Black audience. In this, Hurston may have been ahead of her time.
