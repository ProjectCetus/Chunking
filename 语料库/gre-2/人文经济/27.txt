Recent studies of the gender gap in the history of United States policies tend to focus on candidate 
choice rather than on registration and turnout. This shift in focus from gender inequality in 
political participation may be due to the finding in several studies of voting behavior in the United 
States that since 1980, differences in rates of registration and voting between men and women are 
not statistically significant after controlling for traditional predictors of participation. However, 
Fullerton and Stern argue that researchers have overlooked the substantial gender gap in 
registration and voting in the South. While the gender gap in participation virtually disappeared 
outside the South by the 1950s, substantial gender differences persisted in the South throughout 
the 1950s and 1960s, only beginning to decline in 1970s.
