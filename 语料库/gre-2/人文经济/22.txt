Carolina Hospital notes that Cuban-American writers who write primarily in English are 
dismissed from anthologies and analyses of Cuban exile literature on that account. She argues that 
since these writers were born in Cuba and consider themselves Cuban writers, they should not 
be ignored, and maintains that they represent a new phase of Cubanness, one that is expressed in 
the language comfortable to its writersâ€”English. Moreover, another critic notes that the Spanish 
and English traditions of Cuban-American writing have different but equally viable functions. The 
English branch seeks to create a distinctive culture of Cuban roots in the United States, whereas 
the Spanish branch wishes to preserve a specifically Cuban culture while seeking affiliation with 
the canon of Latin American letters.
