Buell’s study of village sketches (a type of fiction popular in the United States in the 1830s and 
1840s) provides a valuable summary of sketches that portray the community as homogeneous and 
fixed, but it ignores those by women writers, which typically depicted the diversity that 
increasingly characterized actual village communities at that time. These women’s geographical 
mobility was restricted (although women writers of the time were not uniformly circumscribed in 
this way), and their subject matter reflected this fact. Yet their texts were enriched by what 
Gilligan, writing in a different context, has called the ability to attend to voices other than one’s 
own. To varying degrees, the women’s sketches portray differences among community members: 
all stress differences among men and among women (particularly the latter) as well as differences 
between the sexes, and some also depict cultural diversity. These writers represent community as 
dynamic, as something that must be negotiated and renegotiated because of its members’ divergent 
histories, positions, expectations, and beliefs.
