Catherine Stimpson calls for a reassessment of literary merit based on affective standards—on 
how literary works make readers feel—rather than on the aesthetic standards traditionally 
used to define the canon, the body of literary works generally accepted as “great”. Stimpson 
advocates an alterative para canon for literary works, such as Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women, 
because she believes such works have been unjustifiably neglected by 
unsympathetic scholars. According to Stimpson, a para canonical work may or may not have 
literary value by traditional standards; rather, its worth consists in its “capacity to inspire love.” 
Elizabeth Barnes criticizes Stimpson’s approach as subjective and therefore uncritical “Although 
Stimpson never actually defines ‘love,’ she implies that a lovable work is one that so engages the 
reader that its worldview becomes inseparable from the reader’s own” (Stimpson acknowledges 
that the values reflected in Little Women may have subconsciously influenced her invention of the 
para canon). For Barnes ,the conflation of ethics and aesthetics implicit in Stimpson’s approach (in 
which “good ”can refer to something morally sound and/or above average in quality) demonstrates 
the ambiguity inherent in such concepts as goodness and love.
