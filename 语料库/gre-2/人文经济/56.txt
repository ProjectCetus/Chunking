Benjamin Franklin is portrayed in American history as the quintessential self-made man. In 
“Self-reliance”, Emerson asks, “Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin...?” In 
fact, Franklin took instruction widely, and his scientific work was highly collaborative. Friends 
in England sent equipment needed for his electrical experiments, others, in Philadelphia, helped 
him set up his workshop there. Philip Syng constructed a device for generating electrical charges, 
while Tomas Hopkinson demonstrated the potential of pointed conductors. Franklin, in addition to 
being the group’s theoretician, wrote and published its results. His fame as an individual 
researcher is partly a consequence of the shorthand by which when one person writes about 
a group’s discoveries, history sometimes grants singular credit for collective effort.
