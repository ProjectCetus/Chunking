Many cultural anthropologists have come to reject the scientific framework of empiricism that 
dominated the field until the 1970s and now regard all scientific knowledge as socially constructed. 
They argue that information about cultures during the empiricist era typically came from 
anthropologists who brought with them a prepackaged set of conscious and unconscious biases. 
Cultural anthropology, according to the post-1970s critique, is unavoidably subjective, and the 
anthropologist should be explicit in acknowledging that fact. Anthropology should stop striving to 
build a better database about cultural behavior and should turn to developing a more humanistic 
interpretation of cultures. The new framework holds that it may be more enlightening to 
investigate the biases of earlier texts than to continue with empirical methodologies.
