Data of modern and historic peasant communities suggest that individuals and communities 
specialize in ceramic production for trade primarily to offset subsistence shortfalls arising from 
inadequate or insufficient agricultural land. Harry investigated whether this correlation of ceramic 
specialization with agricultural marginality occurred among prehistoric inhabitants of the 
American Southwest. At Arizonaâ€™s West Branch site, occupied A. D. 900-1100, abundant pottery 
manufacturing materials suggest villagewide ceramic production in excess of that needed for 
household purposes.
