Some historians have recently challenged the “party period paradigm,” the view, advanced by 
McCormick and others, that political parties—especially the two major parties—in the United 
States between the years 1835 and 1900 evoked extraordinary loyalty from voters and dominated 
political life. Voss-Hubbard cites the frequency of third-party eruptions during the period as 
evidence of popular antipathy to the two-party regime. He correctly credits third parties with 
helping generate the nineteenth century’s historically high rates of voter turnout by forcing major 
parties to bolster supporters’ allegiance, lest minor parties siphon off their votes, and with pushing 
policy demands that the majorparties ignored. Formisano stresses the pervasive record of 
nonpartisan and anti-party governance at the local level, and women’ s frequent participation in 
nineteenth-century public life, prior to their enfranchisement, in nonpartisan and antiparty ways as 
evidence of the limitations of the party period paradigm. Yet McCormick would deny that the 
existence of antiparty sentiment during the period undermined the paradigm, since he has always 
acknowledged the residual strength of such sentiment during the nineteenth century. In any case, 
the strength of the paradigm is its comparative thrust: the contrast it draws between the period in 
question and earlier and later political eras.
