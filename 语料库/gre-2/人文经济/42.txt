In the 1600s there was intense competition in Europe to discover how to make porcelain. The two 
groups of Europeans working in China—Dutch merchants and French missionaries—each tried to 
discover the Chinese manufacturers’ secrets. The first French missionary journal, was not 
published until 1717, several years after European porcelain manufacture began. 
Therefore, rather than copying the Chinese techniques, the European manufacturers must have 
learned by experiment.
