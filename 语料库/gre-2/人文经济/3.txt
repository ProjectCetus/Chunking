Among many historians a belief persists that Cotton Mather’s biographies of some of the settlers
of the Massachusetts Bay Colony (published 1702) are exercises in hagiography, endowing their
subjects with saintly piety at the expense of historical accuracy. Yet modern studies have profited
both from the breadth of information that Mather provides in, for example, his discussions of
colonial medicineand from his critical observations of such leading figures as Governor John
Winthrop. Mather’s wry humoras demonstrated by his detailed descriptions of events such as
Winthrop’s efforts to prevent wood-stealingis overlooked by those charging Mather with
presenting his subjects as extremely pious. The charge also obscures Mather’s concern with the
settlers material, not just spiritual, prosperity. Further, this pejorative view underrates the
biographies value as chronicles: Mather amassed all sorts of published and unpublished
documents as sources, and his selection of key events shows a marked sensitivity to the nature of
the colony’s development.
