African American drama has, until recently, been rooted in the mimetic tradition of modern
American naturalism. The most distinctive attribute of this tradition is the mechanistic,
materialistic conception of humanity. Naturalism sees each individual as inextricably bound to the
environment and depicts each person as someone controlled by, instead of controlling, concrete
reality. As long as African American drama maintained naturalism as its dominant mode, it could
only express the “plight of African American people”. Its heroes might declare the madness of
reality, but reality inevitably triumphed over them.
The surrealistic plays of Adrienne Kennedy mark one of the first departures from naturalism by an
African American dramatist. The overall goal of her work has been to depict the world of the soul
and the spirit, not to mirror concrete reality. Within this framework, Kennedy has been
able to
portray African American minds and souls liberated from their connections to the external
environment.
