In recent decades, scholars of American literature have skillfully revealed authors’ simultaneous 
accommodation and resistance to an increasingly commercialized, capitalized environment during 
the early nineteenth century. Historians of the period have not, however, fully exploited literary 
criticism, due to the disciplinary boundaries that mark contemporary academic research. Few 
historians have extensive training in critical theory and its specialized languages, and the sheer 
volume of work in early American history and literature challenges anyone who would master 
either field, much less both. Moreover, historians study people across the nation, but much literary 
scholarship called “American” actually examines works produced in northeastern states. And 
historians usually study the operations of capitalism in its details, while literary critics produce a 
generalized picture of literary commodification.
