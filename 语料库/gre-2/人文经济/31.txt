In the life of Charlotte Bronte(1857), the first and the most celebrated biography of novelist 
Charlotte Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell promoted the long-persisting romantic view of Bronte as 
having no connection with the rest of English society at a time when industrialization was causing 
much turbulence, but as having sprung naturally, like so much purple heather, out of the English 
countryside. Gaskell also portrayed Bronte as irreproachably proper, incapable of “unladylike” 
feelings or dangerous views; this was at variance with the subversive spirit Matthew Arnold 
accurately discerned, albeit with distance, deep within Bronte’ s fiction. While correcting many of 
Gaskell’ s errors and omissions at last, even Winifred Gerin’ s Charlotte Bronte: The Evolution of 
Genius(1967) failed to discard Gaskell’ s viewpoint. Feminist have introduced new interpretations 
of Bronte’ s life, but it is primarily Juliet Barker who takes into account the larger world that 
impinged on that life-- the changing England in which old divisions of class and gender were 
under pressure.
