From 1910 to 1913, women suffragists in the United States organized annual parades— activity 
traditionally conducted by men to proclaim solidarity in some cause—not only as a public 
expression of suffragist solidarity but also a conscious transgression of the rules of social order: 
women’s very presence in the streets challenged traditional notions of femininity and restrictions 
on women’s conduct. While recognizing the parade’s rhetorical force as a vehicle for social 
change, scholars have recently begun to examine its drawbacks as a form of protest. Lumsden 
characterizes the American suffrage parade as a “double-edged sword”, arguing that women’s 
efforts to proclaim their solidarity left them open to patronizing commentary from press and 
public and to organized opposition from antisuffragists.
