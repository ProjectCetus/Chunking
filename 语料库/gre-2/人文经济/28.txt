Ralph Ellison was passionately interested in visual arts. He immersed himself in Harlem’s art 
scene in the 1930s, even apprenticing with sculptor Richmond Barthe for a time. Yet he was wary 
of projects aiming to provide a visual rendering of his novel Invisible Man. He reluctantly allowed 
Franklin Library to publish two illustrated versions of the novel but found the results 
disappointing and repeatedly rejected proposed film versions of the book. Despite his involvement 
in visual arts, Ellison insisted that only language could capture the complexity of American 
identity. This complexity consisted of the tension arising from the collision of the United States’ 
written ideals, as outlined in the founding documents, and the historical and contemporary 
experience molding the national consciousness.
