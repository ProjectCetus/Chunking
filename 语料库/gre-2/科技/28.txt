As of late 1980s, neither theorists nor large-scale computer climate models could accurately 
predict whether cloud systems would help or hurt a warming globe. Some studies suggested that a 
four percent increase in stratocumulus clouds over the ocean could compensate for a doubling in 
atmospheric carbon dioxide, preventing a potentially disastrous planet-wide temperature increase. 
On the other hand, an increase in cirrus clouds could increase global warming. 

That clouds represented the weakest element in climate models was illustrated by a study of 
fourteen such models. Comparing climate forecasts for a world with double the current amount of 
carbon dioxide, researchers found that the models agreed quite well if clouds were not included. 
But when clouds were incorporated, a wide range of forecasts was produced. With such 
discrepancies plaguing the models, scientists could not easily predict how quickly the worldâ€™s 
climate would change, nor could they tell which regions would face dustier droughts or deadlier 
monsoons.
