One reason researchers have long believed that Mars never enjoyed an extensive period of warm 
and wet climate is that much of the surface not covered by wind-borne dust appear to be 
composed of unweathered material. If water flowed for an extended period, researchers 
reasoned, it should have altered and weathered the volcanic minerals, creating clays or other 
oxidized, hydrated phases (minerals that incorporate water molecules in their crystal 
structure) . 

It turns out, though, that the scientists were not looking closely enough. New high-resolution 
mapping data and close-up surface studies have revealed clays and other hydrated minerals in 
many regions. The clay deposits are scattered all over, in ancient volcanic surfaces and heavily 
cratered highland regions, some of which have apparently been exposed by erosion only recently.
