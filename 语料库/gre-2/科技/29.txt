Many theorists now doubt that heat loss from Earth’s core and radioactive decay are sufficient by 
themselves to produce all the energy driving the tectonic plates whose movements have helped 
shaped Earth’s surface. This leaves a loose end in current geological theory. Herbert Shaw argues 
that because scientists have underestimated the input of substantial amounts of energy from 
extraterrestrial impactors (asteroids and comets striking Earth), they have difficulty accounting for 
the difference between the quantity of energy produced from sources intrinsic to Earth and that 
involved in plate tectonics. Whereas most geologists have treated the addition of energy through 
the bombardment of Earth’s surface by such impactors as a process separate and independent from 
the movement of Earth’s tectonic plates, Shaw asserts that these processes are indivisible. Shaw’s 
revolutionary “open-system” view recognizes a continuum between terrestrial and extraterrestrial 
dynamics, whereas modern plate tectonic theory, like the classical geology developed during the 
nineteenth century, is founded on the view that Earth’s geological features have changed through 
gradual, regular processes intrinsic to Earth, without reference to unique catastrophic events. 
Classical geology borrowed a decisive, if unspoken, premise from Newton—the independence 
of Earth’s processes from any astronomical context.
