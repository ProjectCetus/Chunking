Constant variations in the amount of sunlight available on Earth at any given location make 
energy storage a necessary design feature of terrestrial solar-energy systems. For systems 
transforming solar to thermal energy, the thermal energy may be stored in matter as either latent 
heat or sensible heat. Latent heat is absorbed or released whenever matter changes phase, as when 
matter changes from liquid to gas, for example, or from gas to liquid. Large heat capacities are 
associated with certain materials, like salts, but in any substance this storage is available only at 
the unique fixed temperature at which the particular phase transition occurs in that substance. 
Moreover, materials that have transitions at the temperatures that terrestrial solar-energy systems 
are likely to encounter are usually destructively corrosive at those temperatures. The storage of 
sensible heat, on the other hand, allows flexibility as to temperature, in addition, safe 
substances like water and most rocks have large sensible heat capacities.
