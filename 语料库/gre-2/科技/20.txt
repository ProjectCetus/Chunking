In most coastal regions, the level of the sea is rising in relation to the land by one to two 
millimeters a year, and this trend would be explained by the hypothesis that at the North and South 
Poles, the amount of ice that melts during the summer now exceeds the amount forms during the 
winter. The hypothesis is not undermined by observations that sea levels are falling relative to 
the Scandinavian coast by four millimeters a year. Much land in northern latitudes, including 
Scandinavia, is still rising in response to being freed of the enormous weight of the ice that used to 
cover it during the last ice age, and in Scandinavia the land is now rising faster than the sea.
