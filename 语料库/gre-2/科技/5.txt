Cuts that need to be held closed in order to heal properly have generally been held closed 
with stitches. However, pressure to reduce medical costs is mounting. Consequently, it is 
likely that a newly developed adhesive will become the routine method of holding most types of 
cuts closed. The new adhesive holds most types of cuts closed as well as stitches do, and the cost 
of applying it is comparable to that of closing cuts with stitches. But whereas stitches must 
generally be removed by medical personnel after the cut has healed, the adhesive simply wears off. 
Thus, for any cut that the adhesive can hold closed as well as stitches can, it is more 
economical to use the adhesive.
