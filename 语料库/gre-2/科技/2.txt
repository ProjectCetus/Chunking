A plant-based automobile fuel has just become available in Ternland. A car can be driven as
far on a gallon of the new plant-based fuel as a car can be driven on a gallon of gasoline, but a
gallon of the plant-based fuel both costs less and results in less pollution. Therefore, drivers in
Ternland who switch to it will reduce the amount they spend on fuel in a year while causing
less environmental damage.
