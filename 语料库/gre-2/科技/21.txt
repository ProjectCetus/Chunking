What accounts for the low-lying, flat surface of Mars’s north? On Earth’s surface, higher- and 
lower-lying areas have different types of crust: one, thin and dense, is pulled toward Earth’s center 
more strongly by gravity, and the planet’s water naturally comes to sit over it, creating oceans. The 
processes that generate this oceanic crust drive plate tectonics. 

Is Mars’s north similarly characterized by a sort of crust different from other areas of the planet? 
Some researchers do see signs of tectonic activity surrounding the northern basin that suggest that 
it was created through the formation of new crust, like ocean basins on Earth. 

However, McGill points to Northern bedrock structures that predate the features said to mark the 
start of the tectonic process. McGill instead believes that through some novel mechanism the 
ancient surface sank to its current depth as a single unit. This would explain why features around 
the basin’s edge, which would have formed as the surface dropped, seem to be younger than 
structures at its floor. 

The third possibility is that the northern lowlands result from impacts. Some researchers suggest 
they formed as a series of big overlapping impact craters. Others arguing that the odds against 
such a pattern of impacts are large, postulate a single event-the impact of an object bigger than any 
asteroid the solar system now contains.
