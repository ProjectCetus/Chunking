The finding that there were rock-melting temperatures on asteroids for sustained periods is 
puzzling: asteroids’ heat source is unknown, and unlike planet-sized bodies, such small bodies 
quickly dissipate heat. Rubin suggests that asteroids’ heat could have derived from collisions 
between asteroids. Skeptics have argued that a single impact would raise an asteroid’s overall 
temperature very little and that asteroids would cool too quickly between impacts to 
accumulate much heat. However, these objections assumed that asteroids are dense, solid bodies. 
A recent discovery that asteroids are highly porous makes Rubin’s hypothesis more plausible. 
When solid bodies collide, much debris is ejected, dissipating energy. Impacts on porous bodies 
generate less debris, so more energy goes into producing heat. Heat could be retained as debris fall 
back into impact craters, creating an insulating blanket.
