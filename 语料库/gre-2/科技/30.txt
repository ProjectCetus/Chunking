Human impacts on the natural environment during the later part of the Holocene (beginning about 
4,000 years ago) complicate investigations into environmental change during that period because 
the signals produced by human-and climate-induced change are sometimes difficult to separate. 
For example, in the later Holocene, one indicator of increased aridity due to climate change is an 
increase in pollen from grasses, as forest vegetation gives way to grassland. Such a change in 
vegetation could alternatively be attributed to human impact in the form of agricultural 
development. Examples of such human impact from 4,000 years ago would be small-scale, 
however, since the broad ecosystem changes brought about by the widespread adoption of 
agricultural technologies occurred later.
