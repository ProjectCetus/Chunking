Astronomers who study planet formation once believed that comets—because they remain mostly 
in the distant Oort cloud, where temperatures are close to absolute zero—must be pristine relics of 
the material that formed the outer planets. The conceptual shift away from seeing comets as 
pristine relics began in the 1970s, when laboratory simulations revealed there was sufficient 
ultraviolet radiation reaching comets to darken their surfaces and there were sufficient cosmic rays 
to alter chemical bonds or even molecular structure near the surface. Nevertheless, astronomers 
still believed that when a comet approached the Sun— where they could study it—the Sun’s 
intense heat would remove the corrupted surface layer, exposing the interior. About the same time, 
though, scientists realized comets might contain decaying radioactive isotopes that could have 
warmed cometary interiors to temperatures that caused the interiors to evolve.
