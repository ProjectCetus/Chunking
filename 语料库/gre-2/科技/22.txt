Most popularizations of science actually do more harm than good. Why? The single most 
important feature of scientific work is not this or that specific result. Instead, what science 
accomplishes--and what physics in particular accomplishes so beautifully--is the linking of diverse 
phenomena, the binding together of a myriad of predictions and explanations. What nearly all 
popularizations do is systematically undermine the progressive reasoning that links principles, 
conventions, experiments, and laws. Bad science writing splinters the most interesting feature of 
science, its long run of connected argumentation, into isolated metaphors that last just long enough 
to evoke a particular result: black holes are said to be huge funnels and quantum electron orbits 
are characterized as diffuse clouds.
