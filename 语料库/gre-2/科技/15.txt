There is mounting evidence that the frequency and magnitude of landsliding is changing in many 
parts of the world in response to climate change. This is not surprising, given that precipitation is 
one of the two external triggering mechanisms--the other being seismic activity--involved in the 
formation of landslides. Evidence from the past clearly indicates that cycles of elevated landslide 
activity have been followed by cycles of low activity, and that these are correlated with climate 
fluctuations over a variety of timescales. 

What sets current changes in landslide activity apart is the likely influence of anthropogenic [i.e., 
human-caused] factors, either acting alone or in concert with climate, which can further modify 
the process of landsliding and the nature of ecosystem responses. Among these factors, 
deforestation and land-use change have the potential to influence the frequency and magnitude of 
landsliding because of their direct effects on vegetation attributes that influence slope stability. 
The extent and conditions under which mountain ecosystems are resilient to these changes--that is, 
the amount of disturbance they can absorb before changing into states with different structure and 
function--are not known. Addressing this issue is crucial for the long-term conservation of 
mountainscapes.
