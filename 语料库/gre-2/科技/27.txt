Most seismologists assume that following a major earthquake and its aftershocks, the fault (a 
break in Earthâ€™s crust where pressure can trigger an earthquake) will remain quiet until stresses 
have time to rebuild, typically over hundreds or thousands of years. Recent evidence of subtle 
interactions between earthquakes may overturn this assumption, however. According to the 
stress-triggering hypothesis, faults are unexpectedly responsive to subtle stresses they acquire as 
neighboring faults shift. Rather than simply dissipating, stress relieved during an earthquake 
travels along the fault, concentrating in sites nearby; even the smallest additional stresses may 
then trigger another quake along the fault or on a nearby fault. Although scientists have long 
viewed such subtle interactions as nonexistent, the hypothesis has explained the location and 
frequency of earthquakes following several destructive quakes in California, Japan, and Turkey.
