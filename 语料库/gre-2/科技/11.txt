Scientific consensus is that humans first began to have a warming effect on Earthâ€™s climate within 
the past century, after coal-burning factories, power plants, and motor vehicles began releasing 
carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases in significant quantities into the air. However, 
evidence suggests that human agricultural activities may have had such an effect much 
earlier: concentrations of CO2 started rising about 8000 years ago, even though natural trends 
indicate they should have been dropping; methane levels rose similarly about 3,000 years later. 
Without these rises, however, current temperatures in northern parts of North America and Europe 
would be cooler by three to four degrees Celsius-enough to inhibit agriculture-and an ice age 
would probably have begun several thousand years ago in northeastern Canada.
