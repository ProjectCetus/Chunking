An island country, a whole continent, Australia has a remarkably cohesive personality and one which, much to our surprise,
 is markedly foreign. It is no longer the infant colony, peopled by British convicts and pioneers, but a maturing, perhaps 
still somewhat adolescent individual, ruggedly steering a vital new course in life.

　　Australia is a sprawl of rock and desert, fringed with lush valleys, snow fields, coral spectaculars, storm-stabbed cliffs 
and rolling beaches, a land rich in minerals, colors, curious flora , 230 species of mammals , 700 of birds, 400 of reptiles, 
70 of amphibia, 2, 200 of fish and 50 , 000 species of insects — and seemingly infinite space . Australia is becoming the 
richest country in the world, materially.

　　Total area of the continent is about half as big as Europe, or 25 times the size of Britain and Ireland. Population is 
bunched mainly in coastal cities, the biggest of which are capitals of the country’s states and the federal capital 
Canberra . Canberra is a model of a planned garden city and is the seat of a major university. It is smallish in size , but big 
in importance. Sydney is the largest city, and commercial capital of the country.

　　Throughout the country, the basic accommodation unit is the motel, a flat prefabricated sprawl of bedrooms. But 
prices are reasonable and, most important, the rooms are excellent and equipped usually with air-conditioning, a 
refrigerator and tea and coffee making facilities. Bath tubs are rare, as Australians prefer the convenience and hygiene of 
a shower. Porterage and other services are rare , as Australians don’t like doing a job which smacks of servility. After all, 
this is the land of equality and opportunity.
