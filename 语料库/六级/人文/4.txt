Although many people do not think of homosexual relationships as resulting in a family, it has been estimated that about 
one of five gays and one of three lesbians enter a homosexual marriage. The marriage may or may not be established by 
a formal ceremony. One male couple , for example , after four months of cohabitation3, went to Mass4 and let the service 
be their private ceremony of commitment. They used the term marriage to describe their relationship. They bought 
matching rings and verbally agreed to be sexually faithful, to emotionally support each other, and to have equal say in 
such matters as finances.

　　Moreover, millions of gays and lesbians have had children. In many cases, the children were born when the individual 
was part of a heterosexual marriage . Subsequently, the individual openly acknowledged his or her homosexual preference. 
Some of these children are being raised in a homosexual family — two men, two women, or some other arrangement. For 
example, Nancy is a lesbian who is raising a daughter with two gay males, one of whom is the child’s father.

　　Homosexual couples have to work through the same problems as heterosexual couples. They face issues of 
household division of labor, power, sexual relationships, and money. In addition, like the interracial couple , they face 
problems arising from being in a socially stigmatized relationship. Gallup polls5 that asked the American public whether 
homosexual relations between consenting adults should be legal have found an increasing proportion from the mid-1970s 
to the late 1990s who said that they should not be legal. Homosexual families, then, must not only deal with the same 
issues as other families but also with a hostile environment and with some problems that are unique to6 the homosexual 
relationship .
