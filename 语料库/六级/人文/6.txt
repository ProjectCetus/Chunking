Zeus told Prometheus to teach the mortals anything they needed to know in order to live . He was also to teach them the 
arts, so that they could build beautiful temples to honor the gods. There was, in fact, only one thing he could not teach 
them.

　　“You may give the mortals any gift except the gift of fire . ”Said Zeus.“ Fire belongs to the gods only, and must be 
kept on Mount Olympus . ”

　　Prometheus was happy to be of service to man. He taught people how to make their own tools and how to build 
homes for themselves. He taught them how to plant and grow their own food, and how to use animals to make their work 
easier. He even taught them how to make music and how to paint. But without fire, life on earth was very difficult. Food 
had to be eaten raw; houses could not be kept warm. Tools had to be of stone , because there was no fire for working 
metal.

　　Athena , daughter of Zeus, had been watching over Prometheus and had helped him in his work. Now, because 
Prometheus was kind and wanted man to be comfortable on earth, he called upon Athena to help him get fire from 
Mount Olympus. She knew that Zeus was away and promised to lead Prometheus to Mount Olympus by a secret path...

　　Just as he arrived Apollo came back from his day’s journey in his chariot of the sun. Prometheus lit a torch from the 
chariot and put the fire in a hollow stalk that he concealed under his cloak. Then he stole away without being seen by 
any of the gods, and brought his fire to earth.

　　When Prometheus lit the first campfire on earth, the people were afraid of it. But they trusted him, and so they came 
closer and closer and enjoyed the fire’s pleasant warmth and beautiful glow.

　　Prometheus knew that he would not have much time before Zeus discovered that he had been disobedient. But he 
also knew that, powerful as Zeus was, once a god had given a gift it could not be taken away. So he quickly taught the 
mortals how to use the gift of fire.
