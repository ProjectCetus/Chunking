In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has revolved around efforts to Lap the consumer market. More 
recently, as the Web proved to be more than a fashion. companies have started to buy and sell products and services with 
one another. Such business-to-business sales make sense because business people typically know what product they're 
looking for.

　　Nonetheless, many companies still hesitate to use the Web because of doubts about its reliability. "Businesses need to 
feel they can trust the pathway between them and the supplier," says senior analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. 
Some companies are limiting the risk by conducting online transactions only with established business partners who are 
given access to the company's private intranet.

　　Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the technology available for marketing. Until recently, 
Internet marketing activities have focused on strategies to "pull" customers into sites. In the past year, however, software 
companies have developed tools chat allow companies to "push" information directly out to consumers, transmitting marketi
ng messages directly to targeted customers, Most notably, the Pointcast Network uses a screen saver to deliver a continually 
updated stream of news and advertisements to subscribers' computer monitors. Subscribers can customize the information 
they want to receive and proceed directly to a company's Web site. Companies such as Virtual Vineyards are already starting 
to use similar technologies to push messages to customers about special sales, product offering, or other events.But push 
echnology has earned the contempt of many Web users. Online culture thinks highly of the notion that the information
 flowing onto the screen comes there by specific request. Once commercial promotion begins to fill the screen uninvited, 
the distinction between the Web and television fades. Thar's a prospect that horrifies Net purists.

　　But it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to resort to push strategies to make money, The examples
 of Virtual Vineyards, Amazon.com and other pioneers show that a Web site selling the right. kind of products with the right 
mix of interactivity, hospitality, and security will attract online customers, And the cost of computing power continues to
 free fall, which is a good sign for any enterprise setting up shop m silicon. People looking back 5 or 10 years from now may 
well wonder why so few companies took the online plunge.
