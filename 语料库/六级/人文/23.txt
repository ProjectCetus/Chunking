Over at our fellow WSJ blog, The Wallet, there's a provocative Q & A with the authors of a new book called smart Girl Marry 
Money, a satirical self-help book which has a serious mission: to get women and men to talk more about marriage and 
finances.
The book came into being when the two working-mom authors, Ford and Drake, M.D., met while picking up their young 
children from preschool. (2)They noticed that the moms who were able to spend the most time with their kids were the 
"moms who hadn't necessarily taken their careers seriously and married someone with money," said Dr. Drake in the 
interview. "It became a joke that if we were smart, we would have married for money."
The authors aren't saying that every woman should aspire to marry a rich guy. But they argue that marriage shouldn't just 
be about love---it should also be an economic partnership (as marriage traditionally was for centuries.) Women and men 
should be more upfront about marriage and money, instead of entering marriage starry-eyed without considering the 
financial future.
Dr. Drake, in the interview, also asserted that women shouldn't abandon their careers, in case of a spouse's illness or 
divorce. "It's an important asset," she said. (The full Q & A can be found here.)
The interview struck a chord for me: I happen to know quite a few women, especially back in New York, for whom the net 
worth of their potential spouses or at least their earning potential-was an important factor in determining suitability for 
marriage. I'm not saying these women married solely for money, but it was a key consideration. Now, after having children
---or in some cases, after marriage none of these women work.
Readers, do you know women or men who have married for money? How important, honestly, were financial 
considerations when evaluating your partner?
