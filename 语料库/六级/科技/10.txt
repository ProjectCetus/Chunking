Icebergs are among nature's most spectacular creations,and yet most people have never seen one.A vague airof mystery 
envelops them.They come into being-somewhere-in faraway,frigid waters,and thunderous noise and splashing turbulence,
which in most cases no one hears or sees. They exist only a short time and then slowly waste away just as unnoticed.

　　Objects of sheerest beauty,they have been called.Appearing in an endless variety of shapes,they may be dazzlingly 
white,or they may be glassy blue,green,or purple,tinted faintly of darker hues.They are graceful,stately,inspiring in calm,
sunlit seas.

　　But they are also called frightening and dangerous,and that they are-in the night,in the fog,and in storms.Even in clear 
weather one is wise to stay a safe distance away from them.Most of their bulk is hidden below the water,so their underwater parts may extend out far beyond the visible top.Also,they may roll over unexpectedly,churning the waters around them.

　　Icebergs are parts of glaciers that break off,drift into the water.float about awhile and finally melt.Icebergs afloat today 
are made of snowflakes that have fallen over long ages of time.They embody snows that drifted down hundred,or many 
thousand,or in some cases,maybe a million years ago.The snows fell in polar-regions and on cold mountains,where they 
melted only a little or not at all and so collected to great depthsover the years and centuries.

　　As each year's snow accumulation lay on the surface,evaporation and melting caused the snowflakes slowly to lose 
their feathery points and become tiny grains of ice.When new snow fell on top of the old,it too turned into icy grains.So 
blankets of snow and ice grains mounted layer upon layer and were of such great thickness that the weight of the upper 
ayers compressed the lower ones.With time and pressure from above,themany small ice grains joined and changed to larger c
rystals,and eventually the deeper crystals merged intoa solid mass of ice.
