Scattered around the globe are more than 100 small regions of isolated volcanic activity known to geologists as hot spots. 
Unlike most of the world's volcanoes. they are not always found at the boundaries of the great drifting plates that make up 
the earth's surface; on the contrary, many of chem lie deep in the interior of a plate. Most of the hot spots move only 
slowly, and in some cases the movement of the plates past them has left trails of dead volcanoes. The bot spots and their 
volcanic trails are milestones that mark the passage of the plates.

　　That the plates are moving is now beyond dispute. Africa and South America. for example. are moving away from each 
other as new material is injected into the sea floor between them. The complementary coastlines and certain geological 
features that seem to span the ocean are reminders of where the two continents were once joined. The relative motion of 
the plates carrying these continents has been constructed in detail, but the motion of one plate with respect to another 
cannot readily be translated into motion with respect to the earth’s interior. It is not possible to determine whether both 
continents are moving in opposite directions or whether one continent is stationary and the other is drifting away from it. 
Hot spots. anchored in the deeper layers of the earth, provide the measuring instruments needed to resolve the question. 
From an analysis of the hot-spot population it appears that the African plate is stationary and that it has not moved during 
the past 30 million years.

　　The significance of hot spots is not confined lo their role as a frame of reference. It now appears that they also have an 
important influence on the geophysical processes chat propel the plates across the globe. When a continental plate comes 
to rest over a hot spot. the material rising from deeper layer creates a broad dome. As the dome grows, it develops deep 
fissures (cracks); in at least a few cases the continent may break entirely along some of these fissures, so that the hoc spot 
initiates the formation of a new ocean. Thus just as earlier theories have explained the mobility of the continents, so hot 
spots may explain their mutability (inconstancy).
