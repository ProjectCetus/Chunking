For centuries,explorers have risked their lives venturing into the unknown for reasons that were to varying degrees 
economic and nationalistic,Columbus went west to look for better trade routes to the Orient and to promote the greater 
glory of Spain.Lewis and Clark journeyed into the American wilderness to find out what the U.S.had acquired when it 
purchased Louisiana,and the Apollo astronauts rocketed to the moon in a dramatic show of technological muscle during 
the cold war.

　　Although their missions blended commercial and political-military imperatives,the explorers involved all accomplished 
some science simply by going where no scientists had gone before.

　　Today Mars looms as humanity's next great terra incognita.And with doubtful prospects for a short-term financial return,
with the cold war a rapidly fading memory and amid a growing emphasis on international cooperation in large space 
ventures,it is clear that imperatives other than profits or nationalism will have to compel human beings to leave their tracks 
on the planet's reddish surface.Could it be that science,which has long played a minor role in exploration,is at last destined 
to take a leading role?The question naturally in vites a couple of others:Are there experiments that only human could do on 
Mars?Couldthose experiments provide insights profound enough to justify the expense of sending people across interplanetary 
space?

　　With Mars the scientific stakes are arguably higher than they have ever been.The issue of whether life ever existed on 
the planet,and whether it persists to this day,has been highlighted by mounting evidence thatthe Red Planet once had 
abundant stable,liquid water and by the continuing controversy over suggestions the bacterial fossils rode to Earth on a 
meteorite(陨石)from Mars.A mor conclusive answer about life on Mars,past or present,would give researchers invaluable 
data about the range of conditions under which a planet can generate the complex chemistry that leads to life.If it could be 
established that life arose independently on Mars and Earth,the finding would provide the first concrete clues in one of the 
deepest mysteries in all of science:the prevalence of life in the universe.
