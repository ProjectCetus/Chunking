impurities and toxins out of our systems.It aids in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients.Infact,nearly every system in our 
bodies relies on water for proper functioning.But what will happen if the water you drink every day is unhealthy?

　　In past decades,concerns about tap water and its impact on overall health led some people to turn to bottled drinking 
water instead.However,in those days,there were few choices of bottled waters.You could pay to have a company deliver 
large bulky plastic bottles of water for the water cooler.Or you could purchase gallon jugs of distilled or “drinking water”
at the grocery store.

　　In recent years,there has been an explosion in the number of different bottled waters available,with big distributors 
such as Coke and Pepsi jumping on the bandwagon.But are bottled drinking waters like Coke's Dasani brand,Pepsi's 
Aquafina,or Wal-Mart's store brand really any healthier than your tap water? Or would you be better off with a drinking 
water filtration system?

　　As we have learned more about the water we drink.the technology behind drinking water filters and purification 
systems has improved dramatically.There are filters to remove impurities,chemicals,heavy metals,bacteria and most every 
contaminant you can think of.With the right size and filter combination for your specific home.your tap water can be 
exceptionally pure and healthy.

　　Cost Comparison

　　Drinking water filtration systems have also become more affordable and easy to use.Although the initial cost of a whole 
house system usually amounts to several hundred dollars,that cost is often less than $100 each year if spread out over the 
life of the system.

　　There may be additional expenses to replace carbon filters,membranes in reverse osmosis drinking water filtration 
system,or lamps in an ultraviolet light water treatment device.These expenses can add another $1000r so to the annual 
costs of operating drinking water filters and purification systems.

　　While some people may hesitate to spend so much each year for clean,safe drinking water,they are probably paying 
more for bottled drinking water.Calculations show that at a price of $l to $4 per gallon,bottled ordelivered water costs an 
average of $400 each year,especially if you purchase individual bottles.And that doesn't take into consideration the gas 
needed to drive to the store or the environmental impact of all the empty plastic bottles.
