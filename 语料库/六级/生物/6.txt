Whether it's curled up in the fetal position , flat on the stomach or stretched out across the bed, the way people sleep 
reveals their personality, a British sleep expert said. The expert has identified six common sleeping positions and what they 
mean. "We are all aware of our body language when we are awake but this is the first time we have been able to see what 
our subconscious says about us, " he said. Crouched in the fetal position is the most popular sleep pattern and favored by 
51 percent of women, according to the results of the study he conducted for a large hotel group. Fetal sleepers tend to be 
shy and sensitive while people who assume the soldier position, flat on their back with arms at their sides, are quiet and
 reserved. Sleeping on one's side with legs outstretched and arms down in what he refers to as the log, indicates a social, 
easygoing personality. But if the arms are outstretched in the yearning position, the person tends to be more suspicious. 
The free fall, flat on the tummy with the hands at the sides of the head, is the most unusual position. Only 6.5 percent of 
people prefer it and they are usually brash and gregarious. Unassuming, good listeners usually adopt the starfish position
 â€” on the back with outstretched arms and legs.The expert, who identified the positions by comparing personality traits of 
people.
