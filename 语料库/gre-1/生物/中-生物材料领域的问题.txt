Currently, the paramount problem in the field of biomaterials, the science of replacing diseased tissue with 
human-made implants, is control over the interface, or surface, between implanted biomaterials and living 
tissues. The physical properties of most tissues can be matched by careful selection of raw materials: metals, 
ceramics, or several varieties of polymer materials. Even the requirement that biomaterials processed from 
these materials be nontoxic to host tissue can be met by techniques derived from studying the reactions of 
tissue cultures to biomaterials or from short-term implants. But achieving necessary matches in physical 
properties across interfaces between living and non-living matter requires knowledge of which molecules 
control the bonding of cells to each other-an area that we have not yet explored thoroughly. Although recent 
research has allowed us to stabilize the tissue-biomaterial interface by controlling either the chemical reactions 
or the microstructure of the biomaterials, our fundamental understanding of how implant devices adhere to 
tissues remains woefully incomplete.
