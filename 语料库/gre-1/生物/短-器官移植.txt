The transplantation of organs from one individual to another normally involves two major problems: 
(1) organ rejection is likely unless the transplantation antigens of both individuals are nearly identical, and 
(2) the introduction of any unmatched transplantation antigens induces the development by the recipient of 
donor-specific lymphocytes that will produce violent rejection of further transplantations from that donor. 
However, we have found that, among many strains of rats, liver transplants are never rejected, and that they 
even induce a state of donor-specific unresponsiveness. Our hypothesis is that (1) many strains of rats simply 
cannot mount a sufficiently vigorous destructive immune-response (using lymphocytes) to outstrip the liver‘s 
relatively great capacity to protect itself from immune-response damage and that (2) the systemic unresponsiveness 
observed is due to concentration of the recipient‘s donor-specific lymphocytes at the site of the liver transplant.
