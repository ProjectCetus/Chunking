Visual recognition involves storing and retrieving memories. Neural activity, triggered by the eye, forms an image in 
the brain`s memory system that constitutes an internal representation of the viewed object. When an object is 
encountered again, it is matched with its internal representation and thereby recognized. Controversy surrounds the 
question of whether recognition is a parallel, one-step process or a serial, step-by-step one. Psychologists of the
Gestalt school maintain that objects are recognized as wholes in a parallel procedure: the internal representation is 
matched with the retinal image in a single operation. Other psychologists have proposed that internal representation 
features are matched serially with an object`s features. Although some experiments show that, as an object becomes 
familiar, its internal representation becomes more holistic and the recognition process correspondingly more parallel, 
the weight of evidence seems to support the serial hypothesis, at least for objects that are not notably simple and 
familiar.
