A mysterious phenomenon is the ability of over-water migrants to travel on course. Birds, bees, and other species can 
keep track of time without any sensory cues from the outside world, and such â€•biological clocks| clearly contribute to
their "compass sense." For example, they can use the position of the Sun or stars, along with the time of day, to find 
north. But compass sense alone cannot explain how birds navigate the ocean: after a flock traveling east is blown far 
south by a storm, it will assume the proper northeasterly course to compensate. Perhaps, some scientists thought, 
migrants determine their geographic position on Earth by celestial navigation, almost as human navigators use stars 
and planets, but this would demand of the animals a fantastic map sense. Researchers now know that some species 
have a magnetic sense, which might allow migrants to determine their geographic location by detecting variations in 
the strength of the Earth`s magnetic field.
