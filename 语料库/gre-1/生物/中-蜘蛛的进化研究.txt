One of the questions of interest in the study of the evolution of spiders is whether the weaving 
of orb webs evolved only once or several times. About half the 35,000 known kinds of spiders 
make webs; a third of the web weavers make orb webs. Since most orb weavers belong either to 
the Araneidae or the Uloboridae families, the origin of the orb web can be determined only by 
ascertaining whether the families are related.

Recent taxonomic analysis of individuals from both families indicates that the families evolved 
from different ancestors, thereby contradicting Wiehleâ€˜s theory. This theory postulates that 
the families must be related, based on the assumption that complex behavior, such as web 
building, could evolve only once. According to Kullman, web structure is the only characteristic 
that suggests a relationship between families. The families differ in appearance, structure of body 
hair, and arrangement of eyes. Only Uloborids lack venom glands. Further identification and study 
of characteristic features will undoubtedly answer the question of the evolution of the orb web.
