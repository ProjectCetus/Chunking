Until about five years ago, the very idea that peptide hormones might be made anywhere in the brain 
besides the hypothalamus was astounding. But laboratory after laboratory found that antiserums to 
peptide hormones, when injected into the brain, bind in places other than the hypothalamus, indicating 
that either the hormones or substances that cross-react with the antiserums are present. The immunological 
method of detecting peptide hormones by means of antiserums, however, is imprecise. Cross-reactions are 
possible and this method cannot determine whether the substances detected by the antiserums really are 
the hormones, or merely close relatives. Furthermore, this method cannot be used to determine the location 
in the body where the detected substances are actually produced. New techniques of molecular biology, 
however, provide a way to answer these questions. It is possible to make specific complementary DNA`s 
(cDNA`s) that can serve as molecular probes to seek out the messenger RNA`s (mRNA`s) of the peptide 
hormones. The brain cells containing these mRNA`s can then be isolated and their mRNA`s decoded to 
determine just what their protein products are and how closely the products resemble the true peptide hormones.
