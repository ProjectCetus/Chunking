Gutman‘s examination of the slaves‘ extended kinship system produces important findings. Gutman discovers that 
cousins rarely married, an exogamous tendency that contrasted sharply with the endogamy practiced by the plantation 
owners. This preference for exogamy, Gutman suggests, may have derived from West African rules governing marriage, 
which, though they differed from one tribal group to another, all involved some kind of prohibition against unions with 
close kin. This taboo against cousins‘ marrying is important, argues Gutman, because it is one of many indications of a 
strong awareness among slaves of an extended kinship network. The fact that distantly related kin would care for 
children separated from their families also suggests this awareness. When blood relationships were few, as in newly 
created plantations in the Southwest, ―fictive‖ kinship arrangements took their place until a new pattern of 
consanguinity developed. Gutman presents convincing evidence that this extended kinship structure—which he 
believes developed by the mid-to-late eighteenth century—provided the foundations for the strong communal 
consciousness that existed among slaves.
