Traditional research has confronted only Mexican and United States interpretations of Mexican-American 
culture. Now we must also examine the culture as we Mexican Americans have experienced it, passing from 
a sovereign people to compatriots with newly arriving settlers to, finally, a conquered peopleä¸€a charter 
minority on our own land. 

When the Spanish first came to Mexico, they intermarried with and absorbed the culture of the indigenous 
Indians. This policy of colonization through acculturation was continued when Mexico acquired Texas in the 
early 1800`s and brought the indigenous Indians into Mexican life and government. In the 1820`s, United States 
citizens migrated to Texas, attracted by land suitable for cotton. As their numbers became more substantial, 
their policy of acquiring land by subduing native populations began to dominate. The two ideologies clashed 
repeatedly, culminating in a military conflict that led to victory for the United States. Thus, suddenly deprived 
of our parent culture, we had to evolve uniquely Mexican-American modes of thought and action in order to survive.
