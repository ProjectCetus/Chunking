Great comic art is never otherworldly, it does not seek to mystify us, 
and it does not deny ambiguity by branding as evil whatever differs 
from good. Great comic artists assume that truth may bear all lights, 
and thus they seek to accentuate contradictions in social action, not 
gloss over or transcend them by appeals to extrasocial symbols of 
divine ends, cosmic purpose, or laws of nature. The moment of 
transcendence in great comic art is a social moment, born out of the 
conviction that we are human, even though we try to be gods. The 
comic community to which artists address themselves is a community 
of reasoning, loving, joyful, compassionate beings, who are willing to 
assume the human risks of acting rationally. Without invoking gods or 
demons, great comic art arouses courage in reason, courage which 
grows out of trust in what human beings can do as humans.
