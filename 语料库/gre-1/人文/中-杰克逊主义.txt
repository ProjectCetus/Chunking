Tocqueville, apparently, was wrong. Jacksonian America was not a fluid, egalitarian society 
where individual wealth and poverty were ephemeral conditions. At least so argues E. Pessen 
in his iconoclastic study of the very rich in the United States between 1825 and 1850. 

Pessen does present a quantity of examples, together with some refreshingly intelligible 
statistics, to establish the existence of an inordinately wealthy class. Though active in 
commerce or the professions, most of the wealthy were not self-made but had inherited 
family fortunes. In no sense mercurial, these great fortunes survived the financial panics that 
destroyed lesser ones. Indeed, in several cities the wealthiest one percent constantly increased 
its share until by 1850 it owned half of the community`s wealth. Although these observations 
are true, Pessen overestimates their importance by concluding from them that the undoubted 
progress toward inequality in the late eighteenth century continued in the Jacksonian period 
and that the United States was a class-ridden, plutocratic society even before industrialization.
