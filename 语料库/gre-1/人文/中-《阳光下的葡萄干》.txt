In Raisin in the Sun, Lorraine Hansberry does not reject integration or the economic and moral promise of the 
American dream; rather, she remains loyal to this dream while looking, realistically, at its incomplete realization. 
Once we recognize this dual vision, we can accept the play's ironic nuances as deliberate social commentaries by 
Hansberry rather than as the "unintentional" irony that Bigsby attributes to the work. Indeed a curiously persistent 
refusal to credit Hansberry with a capacity for intentional irony has led some critics to interpret the play's thematic 
conflicts as mere confusion, contradiction, or eclecticism. Isaacs, for example, cannot easily reconcile Hansberry's 
intense concern for her race with her ideal of human reconciliation. But the play's complex view of Black self-esteem 
and human solidarity as compatible is no more "contradictory" than Du Bois' famous, well-considered ideal of ethnic 
self-awareness coexisting with human unity, or Fanon's emphasis on an ideal internationalism that also accommodates 
national identities and roles.  .
