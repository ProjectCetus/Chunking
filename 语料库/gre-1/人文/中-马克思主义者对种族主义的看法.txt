A Marxist sociologist has argued that racism stems from the class struggle that is unique to the capitalist system-that 
racial prejudice is generated by capitalists as a means of controlling workers. His thesis works relatively well when 
applied to discrimination against Blacks in the United States, but his definition of racial prejudice as "racially-based 
negative prejudgments against a group generally accepted as a race in any given region of ethnic competition," can 
be interpreted as also including hostility toward such ethnic groups as the Chinese in California and the Jews in 
medieval Europe. However, since prejudice against these latter peoples was not inspired by capitalists, he has to reason 
that such antagonisms were not really based on race. He disposes thusly (albeit unconvincingly) of both the intolerance 
faced by Jews before the rise of capitalism and the early twentieth-century discrimination against Oriental people in 
California, which, inconveniently, was instigated by workers.
