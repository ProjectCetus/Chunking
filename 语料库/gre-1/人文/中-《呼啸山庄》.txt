Many critics of Eamily Bronte`s novel Wuthering Heights see its second part as a counterpoint that comments on, if it 
does not reverse, the first part, where a "romantic" reading receives more confirmation. Seeing the two parts as a whole 
is encouraged by the novel`s sophisticated structure, revealed in its complex use of narrators and time shifts. Granted 
that the presence of these elements need not argue an authorial awareness of novelistic construction comparable to 
that of Henry James, their presence does encourage attempts to unify the novel`s heterogeneous parts. However, any 
interpretation that seeks to unify all of the novel`s diverse elements is bound to be somewhat unconvincing. This is not 
because such an interpretation necessarily stiffens into a thesis (although rigidity in any interpretation of this or of any 
novel is always a danger), but because Wuthering Heights has recalcitrant elements of undeniable power that, 
ultimately, resist inclusion in an all-encompassing interpretation. In this respect, Wuthering Heights shares a feature of 
Hamlet.
