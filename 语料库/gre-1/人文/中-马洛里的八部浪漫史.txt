Initially the Vinaver theory that Malory`s eight romances, once thought to be fundamentally unified. were in fact eight 
independent works produced both a sense of relief and an unpleasant shock. Vinaver's theory comfortably explained away 
the apparent contradictions of chronology and made each romance independently satisfying. It was, however, disagreeable 
to find that what had been thought of as one book was now eight books. Part of this response was the natural reaction to 
the disturbance of set ideas. Nevertheless, even now, after lengthy consideration of the theory`s refined but legitimate 
observations, one cannot avoid the conclusion that the eight romances are only one work. It is not quite a matter of 
disagreeing with the theory of independence, but of rejecting its implications: that the romances may be taken in any or no 
particular order, that they have no cumulative effect, and that they are as separate as the works of a modern novelist.
