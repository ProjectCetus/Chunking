Throughout human history there have been many stringent taboos concerning watching other people eat or eating 
in the presence of others. There have been attempts to explain these taboos in terms of inappropriate social 
relationships either between those who are involved and those who are not simultaneously involved in the satisfaction 
of a bodily need, or between those already satiated and those who appear to be shamelessly gorging. Undoubtedly 
such elements exist in the taboos, but there is an additional element with a much more fundamental importance. In 
prehistoric times, when food was so precious and the on-lookers so hungry, not to offer half of the little food one had 
was unthinkable, since every glance was a plea for life.
