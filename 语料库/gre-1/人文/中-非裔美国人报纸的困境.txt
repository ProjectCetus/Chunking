African American newspapers in the 1930s faced many hardships. For instance, 
knowing that buyers of African American papers also bought general-circulation 
papers, advertisers of consumer products often ignored African American 
publications.  Line Advertisers` discrimination did free the African American press 
from advertiser domination. Editors could print politically charged material more 
readily than could the large national dailies, which depended on advertisers` 
ideological approval to secure revenues. Unfortunately, it also made the selling 
price of Black papers much higher than that of general-circulation dailies. 
Often as much as two-thirds of publication costs had to come from subscribers 
or subsidies from community politicians and other interest groups. And despite 
their editorial freedom, African American publishers often felt compelled to print 
a disproportionate amount of sensationalism, sports, and society news to boost 
circulation.
