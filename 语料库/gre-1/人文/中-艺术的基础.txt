The belief that art originates in intuitive rather than rational faculties was worked out historically and philosophically 
in the somewhat wearisome volumes of Benedetto Croce, who is usually considered the originator of a new aesthetic. 
Croce was, in fact, expressing a very old idea. Long before the Romantics stressed intuition and self-expression, the 
frenzy of inspiration was regarded as fundamental to art, but philosophers had always assumed it must be controlled 
by law and by the intellectual power of putting things into harmonious order. This general philosophic concept of art 
was supported by technical necessities. It was necessary to master certain laws and to use intellect in order to build 
Gothic cathedrals, or set up the stained glass windows of Chartres. When this bracing element of craftsmanship ceased 
to dominate artists` outlook, new technical elements had to be adopted to maintain the intellectual element in art. 
Such were linear perspective and anatomy.
