Only an effective collaboration between filmmakers and art historians can create films that will enhance 
viewers' perceptions of art. Filmmakers need to resist the impulse to move the camera quickly from detail 
to detail for fear of boring the viewer, to frame the image for the sake of drama alone, to add music for 
fear of silence. Filmmakers are aware that an art object demands concentration and, at the same time, are 
concerned that it may not be compelling enoughâ€•and so they hope to provide relief by interposing "real" 
scenes that bear only a tangential relationship to the subject. But a work of art needs to be explored on its 
own terms. On the other hand, art historians need to trust that one can indicate and analyze, not solely with 
words, but also by directing the viewer's gaze. The specialized written language of art history needs to be 
relinquished or at least tempered for the screen.
