Currently, there are two models of solar activity. The first supposes that the Sun's internal motions (caused 
by rotation and convection) interact with its large-scale magnetic field to produce a dynamo, a device in which 
mechanical energy is converted into the energy of a magnetic field. In short, the Sun's large-scale magnetic 
field is taken to be self-sustaining, so that the solar- activity cycle it drives would be maintained with little overall 
change for perhaps billions of years. The alternative explanation supposes that the Sun's large-scale magnetic 
field is a remnant of the field the Sun acquired when it formed, and is not sustained against decay. In this model, 
the solar mechanism dependent on the Sun's magnetic field runs down more quickly. Thus, the characteristics of 
the solar-activity cycle could be expected to change over a long period of time.
