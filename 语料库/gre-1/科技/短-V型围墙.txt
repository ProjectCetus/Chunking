V-shaped walled structures in central Asia were used by prehistoric hunters who drove hoofed animals into an 
enclosure at the point of the V. The central Asians who built these structures probably learned this hunting technique 
from invaders from southwest Asia, because the arrival of invaders from a region in southwest Asia where similar 
structures had long been used coincides roughly with the building of the earliest of such structures in central Asia.
