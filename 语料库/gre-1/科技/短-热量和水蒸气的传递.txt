The transfer of heat and water vapor from the ocean to the air above it depends on a disequilibrium at 
the interface of the water and the air. Within about a millimeter of the water, air temperature is close to 
that of the surface water, and the air is nearly saturated with water vapor. But the differences, however 
small, are crucial, and the disequilibrium is maintained by air near the surface mixing with air higher up, 
which is typically appreciably cooler and lower in water-vapor content. The air is mixed by means of 
turbulence that depends on the wind for its energy. As wind speed increases, so does turbulence, and 
thus the rate of heat and moisture transfer. Detailed understanding of this phenomenon awaits further study.
