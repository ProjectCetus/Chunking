Since science tries to deal with reality, even the most precise sciences normally work with more or less imperfectly 
understood approximations toward which scientists must maintain an appropriate skepticism. Thus, for instance, it may 
come as a shock to mathematicians to learn that the Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom is not a literally correct 
description of this atom, but only an approximation to a somewhat more correct equation taking account of spin, magnetic 
dipole, and relativistic effects; and that this corrected equation is itself only an imperfect approximation to an infinite set of 
quantum field-theoretical equations. Physicists, looking at the original Schrodinger equation, learn to sense in it the 
presence of many invisible terms in addition to the differential terms visible, and this sense inspires an entirely appropriate 
disregard for the purely technical features of the equation. This very healthy skepticism is foreign to the mathematical 
approach. Mathematics must deal with well-defined situations. Thus, mathematicians depend on an intellectual effort 
outside of mathematics for the crucial specification of the approximation that mathematics is to take literally.
