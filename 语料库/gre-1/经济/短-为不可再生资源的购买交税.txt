Years ago, consumers in Frieland began paying an energy tax in the form of 
two Frieland pennies for each unit of energy consumed that came from 
nonrenewable sources. Following the introduction of this energy tax, there 
was a steady reduction in the total yearly consumption of energy from 
nonrenewable sources.
